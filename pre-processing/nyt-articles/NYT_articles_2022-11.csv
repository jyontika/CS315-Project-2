A particular method, for lack of a better word, thrived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries — targeted efforts by white mobs to violently destroy Black communities. In 1919, there were so many attacks between May and August alone that the writer James Weldon Johnson termed it “The Red Summer.” In 1923, the community of Rosewood, Fla., was razed; and the list goes on, with far too many such tragedies to cite here. But since 2019’s HBO hit “Watchmen,” only one of these massacres has become a cultural shorthand: the Tulsa massacre of 1921, in which thousands of white people stormed the city’s Greenwood district and burned it to the ground, killing an estimated 300 African Americans and leaving thousands homeless.

I happened to live in these parts for three years, and I crossed the overpass twice a day most days.

Gas has yet to be connected. “We are able to provide about 75 percent of our menu as it is,” Mr. Livanos said. Added to the menu and not derailed by the lack of fuel is a new section of raw, chilled and marinated dishes like Ionian hamachi crudo with anise carrot purée, ouzo-cured salmon, marinated sardines en croute and smoked Ioanian eel with a ouzo-blood orange glaze.

The owners, Maguy Le Coze and the chef, Eric Ripert, have planned a dinner to mark the occasion. Ms. Le Coze and her brother, Gilbert, first opened their seafood restaurant in 1972 on the Left Bank in Paris, with a view of Notre Dame, then relocated the restaurant near the Arc de Triomphe. They made the trans-Atlantic move to the present location in New York in 1986, as an anchor in a collection of restaurants in a new office tower on Seventh Avenue. The restaurant received four stars in its first New York Times review, three months after opening, a top ranking it has maintained over decades. In Paris it received two stars from Michelin, but was never awarded the ultimate three. (Mr. Le Coze contended that it was because they only served fish.) When Michelin introduced its New York guide in 2005, the restaurant finally achieved the third star. It was a pinnacle that Mr. Le Coze was unable to enjoy: He died unexpectedly of a heart attack in 1994. Ms. Le Coze kept the restaurant going with Mr. Ripert, who became her partner in the restaurant. To mark the anniversary they have organized a $1,000 per person six-course dinner on Wednesday with 10 percent going to the charity City Harvest, which Mr. Ripert supports. The menu combines echoes of Le Bernardin classics, like the pounded tuna first course; and monkfish with a sunchoke purée replacing melted leeks. (Mr. Le Coze is often credited with popularizing monkfish for the American audience.) In recent years, Le Bernardin has always been at or near the top of global restaurant awards.",Le Bernardin Celebrates Its 50th Anniversary,2022-11-07T17:40:37+0000,article,Food,News,"Le Bernardin (Manhattan, NY, Restaurant);Restaurants;Philanthropy;Pies;Museums"

Pierre Gagnaire, whose work at Saint-Étienne in Paris has earned him three Michelin stars, is supervising the menu. The executive chef, Bradley Stellings, who worked with Alain Ducasse and his second-in-command, Didier Elena, said that Mr. Gagnaire’s signature, typically a refreshing touch of citrus, could be found in a number of traditional dishes, even the French onion soup. Count on oysters, escargots, caviar service, lobster fricassee, chicken paillard, a salmon casserole with Champagne, and, for dessert, the signature mille-feuille and profiteroles. Sharing the hotel lobby is Par Ici Cafe, for more casual Mediterranean fare in an indoor-outdoor setting with a garden. There are also several bars throughout.

Asch, who moved her New York-based studio, Brrch, to Los Angeles in late 2020 and has used the flower in her dreamy, lyrical arrangements, says that because florists in, say, Miami or Hawaii have better access to tropical hibiscuses than their counterparts in New York, this creates an “element of exclusivity” — compounded, perhaps, by the brief life of the blossoms — that renders them even more desirable.","Why the Showy, Short-Lived Hibiscus Is the Flower of Our Time",2022-11-11T12:00:10+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Flowers and Plants;Florists;Orchids;Gardens and Gardening;Orlean, Susan;Hawaii"

This past April, convinced that a meditative state of mind is more necessary than ever in our double-time world, he brought koh-do to Ogata Paris, the three-floor Japanese restaurant, gallery and boutique he opened in the city’s Marais neighborhood in 2020.","In Paris, a New Incense Room to Awaken the Senses",2022-11-11T14:00:09+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Ogata, Shinichiro;Perfumes and Fragrances;ARCHITECTURE;Marais (Paris, France);Japan"

2526,Five retellings of classic tales let the light shine through the cracks.,"When my son, Noah, was younger, he had a small stuffed bunny he named L.F., short for Lost and Found. As its name predicted, L.F. was lost and found and lost and found. Over and over. Each time it returned, L.F. was a little more worn. A stain on the back of its neck in the shape of a star appeared. Its soft pompom tail shrunk to half its size like a melting snowball. The scratched plastic eyes deepened and grew wise; the left eye loosened and eventually fell off. When Noah first told me L.F.’s name, I thought he’d said “Alef,” like the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet. I thought he’d named it after an ancient scratch, the beginning of something that has, as far as we know, no end. The last time I remember seeing L.F., he was more story than bunny, more memory than animal: the well-loved thing knocked, and snipped, and cracked, and thinned enough for new light to shine through. It is new stuffing in old skin. The fractured fairy tale is a bunny called Lost and Found with one original eye and one brown button to replace what once fell off and disappeared.","Once Upon a Time, Things Took an Unexpected Turn",2022-11-11T17:25:00+0000,article,Books,Review,"Books and Literature;Gold (Book);The Wolf Suit (Book);Sharp, Sid (Illustrator);Too Many Pigs and One Big Bad Wolf: A Counting Story (Book);Cali, Davide;Balducci, Marianna (Illustrator);Three Little Vikings (Book);Woollvin, Bethan;The Three Billy Goats Gruff (Book);Barnett, Mac;Klassen, Jon"

This poem relies on repeated elements, attempting to make a self out of violence — the anaphora of “For,” the colons throughout, and the repetition of “rejoice rejoice.” The speaker grapples with the challenges of passive acceptance within past and current violence. “Rejoice” is religious language that means “to be glad” or “to take delight.” This language is juxtaposed next to the theft and auction of Indigenous bones and objects: “Mother, tell me/what you remember of another man’s hand/reaching into your throat,” the speaker asks. The bones keep singing “rejoice rejoice” as a way to both lament and reclaim the speaker’s and his ancestor’s bodies.

The group will open its newest property, Eastwind Oliverea Valley, in the area this January. It joins the ranks of hotels like Wildflower Farms and Inness in the rejuvenation of the mountainous stretch of upstate New York that’s just a short drive away from the city. Oliverea Valley’s 30 accommodations — a mix of free-standing A-frame cabins and stylish guest rooms in a central building — mark the first time the brand, which also operates hotels in Windham and Lake Placid, has “started from scratch,” says Boyer. The interiors are inspired by the Scandinavian sentiment of hygge, with wood furnishings, gently worn rugs and sheepskin throws. Just 25 miles away is another newcomer: Hotel Lilien, an 18-room boutique hotel and cocktail bar designed by the San Francisco-based firm Field Theory in collaboration with the Lost Boys Hospitality Group, which opened for weekend stays in August but will be fully bookable starting Dec. 1. The hotel features a mix of furnishings that pay homage to the original 1890s architecture of the property. Think “a blue-green Wes Anderson-esque reception nook, Huey sconces, Mulberry duck motif wallpaper, a black-and-white checkered tumbled marble entry floor and antique Persian rugs,” all of which took “over a year” to hunt down, said Leah Harmatz, founder and principal designer at Field Theory. “We layered in pieces from different eras, just as someone who lived in a home over many decades would slowly amass an inspired and meaningful collection of furniture and art.”",A New Book Shows Sies Marjan’s Colors Haven’t Faded,2022-11-17T14:00:08+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Art;Cooking and Cookbooks;Fashion and Apparel;Sies Marjan (Fashion Label);Cave, Nick (1959- );Picasso, Pablo;Candles;Catskill Mountains"

3712,The newly opened Olinto is a serene escape in the foothills of the Atlas Mountains.,"In the early ’90s, Fabrizio Ruspoli di Poggio Suasa, a French Italian aristocrat from Paris and a former dealer in 18th-century French furniture, moved to Marrakesh. Ruspoli, who grew up visiting his grandmother in Morocco, quickly felt at home among the city’s well-known expats — among them at the time the interior designer Bill Willis, the fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent and his partner, Pierre Bergé — and soon purchased the popular French restaurant La Maison Arabe, transforming it into the medina’s first riad hotel. But in the three decades since his arrival, says Ruspoli, Marrakesh has, for better and worse, grown “along with the noise of scooters.” So three years ago, he decided to sell the hotel to seek a quieter life about an hour’s drive outside of town in the Atlas Mountains. But not too quiet: This fall, Ruspoli and his longtime partner, José Abete, opened a new property, Olinto, in the lush Ouirgane Valley. Set on 10 acres planted with olive groves and fragrant gardens, the hotel has dramatic views of the red earth mountains, with nine vine-covered guesthouses with rooftop sitting areas, private gardens and, in some cases, pools. A spa will open sometime next year, but for now, guests can lounge on the many wisteria-lined terraces and enjoy massages in the traditional hammam. Ruspoli, who says he was “born playing a piano,” named his new project in honor of his like-minded ancestor Marquis Francesco Maria Ruspoli, a patron of Handel, who adopted the moniker Olinto, after a village in ancient Greece, as part of his membership in a musical and literary society called the Academy of Arcadia. “My hope is to host something similar here: a retreat and, eventually, a small music festival surrounded by my gardens,” he says.

From the top of the gently sloped 6.3-acre lot, they would follow a wide brick path under a canopy of native chicalá and guayacán trees to its end at a solitary brick lintel hung with dangling ferns. Through the threshold, they would enter the first of the house’s three courtyards, square enclosures staggered along a diagonal and sutured together by a brick canal, a furrow in the ground’s otherwise flat pavers, and ending in a fountain. In the second patio, they would climb a staircase that spread to a roofscape of catwalks and barrel vaults, eventually descending to the final terrace and out again into the garden that Salmona and Madriñán, now 67, had spent more than a decade planting before they laid the house’s first brick. Only after circumambulating the 1,625-square-foot house, named Casa Río Frío for the stream that bounds the property to the east, and only if his visitors insisted, would Salmona take them inside for a perfunctory tour of its monastic interiors: its two baths and three bedrooms, its kitchen and living room and studio, built in concrete, granadillo wood and, most of all, brick.",The Colombian Architect Who Reimagined Modernism for a New Era,2022-11-22T12:00:20+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Salmona, Rogelio;ARCHITECTURE;Colombia;Bogota (Colombia);Le Corbusier;Brick and Tile;Concrete;Content Type: Personal Profile"

But before all of that, there was honey. The first thing Christiansen — the founder of the ad agency Chandelier Creative — did upon moving to his densely vegetated seven-acre property in Los Angeles’s Highland Park in 2016 was establish some beehives. As a child in rural Australia, he had been surrounded by his parents’ hives: “It’s just this timeless, beautiful thing that everyone can do,” he says. Earlier this year, Christiansen installed hives in the gardens of a few famous friends and fans of Flamingo Estate, with all proceeds from the resulting honey sold this holiday season going to a number of charities, including Cancer for College and Refugees International. In southern Portugal, the artist Ai Weiwei’s bees are feasting on olive trees. Will Ferrell, Tiffany Haddish and LeBron and Savannah James have hives in different parts of Los Angeles, and Julianne Moore has been hosting hers in Montauk, on Long Island. “These bees are like my children, so I only wanted them to go to the best places,” Christiansen says. (His own swarm was used for the Los Angeles sites; elsewhere, he relied on trusted local apiarists.) Going forward, he plans to introduce his bees to other fabulous gardens. As he sees it, it’s a kind of vacation for these industrious insects. “These bees wake up,” he says, “and they fly out to the most amazing view.” From $250, flamingoestate.com. — Ella Riley-Adams",A New Range of Honey From the Gardens of LeBron James and Ai Weiwei,2022-11-22T13:00:09+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Furniture;Honey;Fashion and Apparel;Jewels and Jewelry;Flamingo Estate (Los Angeles, Calif, Retailer)"

After completing his degree in industrial design at the Media and Design Academy in Genk and following a stint as a runway model for the fashion designer Raf Simons (who had also studied in Genk), Verheyden, now 44, began making handbags from a studio in his hometown. In 2007, he moved into a 1,600-square-foot townhouse in the center of the city with his wife, Saartje Vereecke, 46; together, they established a design firm under his name that sells objects like precisely tailored leather place mats and minimalist furnishings such as solid oak stools.

We see opportunities.”","In Belgium, a Home That Celebrates the Elegance of Utility",2022-11-29T10:00:37+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Belgium;Verheyden, Michael;Real Estate and Housing (Residential);Interior Design and Furnishings;Tables;Design;Simons, Raf;Genk (Belgium)"

The neighborhood — a tangle of streets radiating from the 11th-century Saint-Germain-des-Prés abbey — was in those days a sanctuary for artists, poets and freethinkers, a place where philosophers and writers like Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir would gather in cafes to share ideas. “There was a deep sense of intellectual freedom,” Rauzy says. His father, a dentist, had an office on the first floor of the six-story early 18th-century building, where he would tend to the neighborhood’s eclectic residents. “Some of them went to see the dentist after visiting Serge Gainsbourg,” Rauzy recalls, referring to his family’s onetime neighbor, the famed pop provocateur, “so of course they were full of whiskey!” Decades later, the area is known for its clothing boutiques and galleries. But Rauzy, now joined by his partner in life and work, Anthony Watson, 40, still calls Saint-Germain-des-Prés, and the apartment he grew up in, home.","In Paris, an Apartment Built on Heirlooms and Wicker",2022-11-30T10:00:54+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Interior Design and Furnishings;Paris (France);Watson, Anthony (Designer);Textiles;Antiques"
