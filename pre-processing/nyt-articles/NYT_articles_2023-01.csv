72,"Originally published in 1939, “The Hopkins Manuscript,” by the British writer R.C. Sherriff, inaugurated a genre of post-apocalyptic fiction in which a resourceful hero survives unthinkable cataclysm.","In “Billion Year Spree,” his influential 1973 study of science fiction, the writer Brian Aldiss identified a kind of post-apocalyptic novel that he called “the cozy catastrophe.” These were stories about the end of the world in which a resourceful survivor — usually a British man from the middle class — puts together a relatively comfortable life for himself in the ruins. Although the genre is often associated with the work of John Wyndham, especially “The Day of the Triffids” (1951), Aldiss traced it back to THE HOPKINS MANUSCRIPT (Scribner, 385 pp., paperback, $18), by R.C. Sherriff, which first appeared in 1939. Reissued this month, this wonderful novel should powerfully resonate with readers whose consciences are troubled by inequality and climate change.

200,"Heidrun Meadery, which makes mead in the style of Champagne, has teamed up with the World Honey Exchange on a new line of sparkling meads.","Heidrun Meadery was opened in 1997 by Gordon Hull, a geologist and former brewer who began making mead, the ancient honey-based fermented beverage, like Champagne, with a second fermentation in the bottle. Originally based in Arcata, in Northern California, 10 years ago he moved his operation and established his own hives further south, in Point Reyes Station, Calif., near San Francisco. His varietal sparkling meads use honeys close to home and farther afield (Marin County Wildflower and Hawaiian Lehua Blossom, for example), each resulting in distinct aromas and flavors, just the way Champagnes are distinguished by terroir and cuvée. Now, to encourage small beekeepers worldwide, he and Michael Zilber, his managing director, have introduced the World Honey Initiative Collection, three new international sparkling meads in partnership with the World Honey Exchange, an organization that helps honey cooperatives. The Ethiopian Geteme Blossom sparkling mead is pale and floral, slightly bitter, with a honeyed aftertaste. Chilean Ulmo Blosson is a deeper gold, with hints of spice and mellow richness. Tanzanian Miombo Wildflower is amber, full-bodied with an alluring smokiness, making it a fine partner for cheese.",Meads That Celebrate Honeys From Around the Globe,2023-01-03T17:32:51+0000,article,Food,News,Cooking and Cookbooks;Books and Literature;Salmon;Tortillas;Cardamon;Indian Food (Cuisine);Spices

The two came up with the idea while traveling in the region. The result is a fairly compact dining room, mostly with high-top tables and creamy leather upholstered chairs that share the space with the bar. (More tables are set in an L-shaped extension for a total of 80 seats.) Walls are sheathed in pale wood and light, deeply textured Turkish volcanic stone; woven Turkish runners are placed over the tablecloths. The chef, Hasan Karci from Turkey, worked at Ritz-Carltons in Istanbul and Palm Beach. The Greek repertoire is represented by tzatziki, keftedes (meatballs), baked shrimp saganaki, lemon potatoes and lavraki (branzino). The pacanga pastry with pastrami, ezme dips and shredded phyllo knafeh are Turkish. Lamb chops and a baklava ice cream sandwich celebrate both countries. A liquor license is expected this month, its absence filled by a long list of timely mocktails, mostly made with tropical fruit juices; when alcohol becomes available, there will be French, Italian, Californian and Australian wines, including high-end labels like Solaia and Château Lafite Rothschild, with some Greek and Turkish wines as well.

422,"Plus: beauty tips from a makeup artist, a renovated Swiss restaurant and more recommendations from T Magazine.","The morning is very simple: I shower and wash my face with the Deep Cleanse exfoliating cleanser from Tatcha and, once a week, I’ll use this Sisley-Paris Exfoliating Enzyme Mask. That has been great for the discoloration on my skin. On my body I’ll use the Grown Alchemist Intensive Body Exfoliant followed by the Tatcha Hinoki Body Milk while my skin is still wet. Unlike a lot of creams that just sit on the skin, this really hydrates and sinks in. I wear the Tatcha Indigo Overnight Repair serum during the day, because I have eczema and it’s really protective, and EltaMD UV Clear SPF 46. I just got back from Japan and discovered this really great gender-neutral complexion line called Iroiku. It helps neutralize the undertones of the skin and gives you this really beautiful, balanced complexion, so I’ve been wearing that when I’m on camera. And I have a few things I always carry: Honest Beauty Magic Beauty Balm, I use it as a highlighter, elbow cream, everything. On my lips I use the Sisley-Paris Nutritive Lip Balm, which is heavier for winter. Lastly, no one seems to understand Tatcha’s Serum Stick — you can slather it all over your skin or on top of makeup if it’s starting to dry out, but I use it any time I’m feeling a bit dry or am getting flaky skin around my nose. A few times a week I’ll use 111Skin Celestial Black Diamond mask or Jaxon Lane’s Bro Mask, which has a lot of caffeine and niacinamide in it. I tried the Theraface Pro after giving one to a client who loved it, and I’ve noticed it really de-puffs and the LED lights help with breakouts. I also see Joanna Vargas for Triple Crown facials. The first time I saw her it changed my skin. I’ve been bald for so long and I’m very particular about my head-shaving ritual. I always use this Gillette Ultra Sensitive Shave Gel, but the trick is that you need to exfoliate the skin before and after. I’ve been using Tatcha’s Texture Tonic as an after-shave and I don’t get any bumps or razor burn — and it doesn’t sting. I even tell my clients to use it on legs or underarms where they might get bumps. The first fragrance I bought in college at the Nordstrom in Seattle was L’Eau d’Issey and it’s still the one I go back to.","In the Mountains of Lebanon, a Centuries-Old Guesthouse Welcomes New Visitors",2023-01-05T14:00:08+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Valle, Giancarlo;Restaurants;Furniture;Cosmetics and Toiletries;Lebanon"

They want to have access to drinking water outside of the bathroom. They are employed at a family business and are ambitious but there’s no room for advancement for nonfamily members. They work at a very small company without a formal H.R. department so there is no recourse for the many work issues that arise. They want to have more time for themselves and interests beyond how they spend their professional lives. They want and want and want and worry that they will never receive the satisfaction they seek.","Yes, Your Job Is Important.

At the suggestion of one of those friends, he took a 12-week training course at the House of Truth wrestling school in Center Line, Mich., and then entered the indie circuit as a hand: an unknown, unpaid wrestler who shows up at events and does what’s asked of him, typically setting up the ring, pretending to be a lawyer or other species of extra, maybe participating in a battle royale. For the next few years, he worked shows around the Great Lakes region, wrestling strangers or sometimes the guy he rode up with, trying to figure out where he fit in.

It finally happened on Dec. 31. “I think it turned out for the best,” said the chief executive Shelley Armistead. She was taking a brief break from waiting tables in the restaurant’s upstairs dining room; she pitches in from time to time. The restaurant serves only breakfast and lunch, no reservations. Ms. Armistead cited the pandemic, construction and permits for the delays; dinner was not planned right out of the gate, and will not be served until more staff is trained. “But when you serve breakfast, you attract the neighborhood, not Instagram followers,” she said. The two-story, 120-seat space has a cafe area in front and a bright, rustic bare-table dining room with an open kitchen, bar and counter beyond. Upstairs, you’ll find two polished dining rooms and a bar with plush mohair banquettes and a sunny front area. In Los Angeles, the Gjelina Group has a bakery, a takeout shop and other retail venues, some of which Ms. Armistead is hoping to transport to New York. Ms. Armistead described the Gjelina Group as a “collective of 550 people,” taking the approach that they give as much financial support as possible directly to suppliers, like farmers, anglers, weavers, ceramists and flower cultivators. A collaborative menu helmed by Juan Hernandez consists of largely produce-driven specialties like lemon buckwheat ricotta pancakes, a frittata with leeks and herbs, and Moroccan baked eggs with merguez for breakfast; oysters, lamb tartare, smoked mackerel with arugula, roasted arrowhead cabbage in bagna cauda, einkorn pappardelle with brisket, duck confit with red cabbage, and 10 inventive pizzas, including one with mixed mushrooms and garlic confit. On the list of desserts is an apple clafoutis and buttermilk panna cotta with tahini.

1244,"Plus: a modern French steakhouse, upcycled fashion and more recommendations from T Magazine.","Experimental and theatrical are among the words commonly used to describe the chef Paul Pairet’s culinary vision at Ultraviolet, his triple Michelin-star restaurant in Shanghai.

Replacing the hotel’s former Brasserie d’Aumont and men’s grooming space, Nonos by Paul Pairet, with its moody interior by Tristan Auer, is the chef’s take on a modern French steakhouse (the name means little bone in children’s French). “I wanted to revive a retro-chic format of steakhouse dining from the ’60s and ’70s where the grill was front and center, servers came to the table with trolleys to slice meat and cheese, and dishes had broad appeal but were enhanced with the best products available,” explains the Perpignan-born Pairet. The menu is focused on familiar favorites ranging from onion soup and cheese soufflés to traditional dishes like seafood vol-au-vent. Comestibles, the deli area, will serve up snacks such as deviled eggs, pâté en croûte and Gascon cured ham. “Traditional French food is back in a big way across Paris,” Pairet says. “To do it right in an iconic setting like this — it’s a chef’s dream.” rosewoodhotels.com",A Japanese Retreat That Brings New Meaning to Forest Bathing,2023-01-12T14:00:13+0000,article,T Magazine,News,Fashion and Apparel;Furniture;Travel and Vacations;Hotels and Travel Lodgings;Restaurants;Hokkaido (Japan);Paris (France)

1917,"Plus: buzzy hotels, psychedelic collages and more recommendations from T Magazine.","When the hospitality company Dovetail + Co. first envisioned a Hawaii outpost for Wayfinder, the boutique hotel brand whose original Rhode Island location is beloved for its Newport-specific charm, the group’s owner, Phil Hospod, knew he wanted to design a place that drew from “the B-side” of Waikiki, a reference to the lesser-known songs often found on a record’s flip side. The Wayfinder Waikiki is accordingly situated not on the oceanfront but on the (relatively) quiet Ala Wai Boulevard, with sweeping views of Diamond Head and the Koʻolau mountain range. (Still, it’s just a short three-block walk to the white sands and surf breaks.) The hotel’s rough-hewn ’60s Brutalist structure — a rarity among the neighborhood’s muted high-rises and tiki kitsch — now features eclectic, tropical interiors courtesy of the local design studio the Vanguard Theory. Drawing inspiration from the islands’ rich heritage, custom furnishings and textiles blend multicultural motifs for the 228 rooms. (Think: checkered palaka prints on pillows with aloha shirt designs and Japanese obi belt-inspired patterns decorating headboards.) A three-story Spanish terra-cotta building, housing rooms with kitchenettes, overlooks a 70-foot saltwater lagoon pool. Determined to give visitors a more insider experience of the island, Hospod and his team have partnered with a number of local businesses and organizations such as the record label Aloha Got Soul, which supplies the lobby with rare Hawaii vinyl reissues. The Bishop Museum, a century-old institution dedicated to Hawaii’s culture, is involved in creating a volunteer program for guests. In April, the hotel plans to open two on-site dining venues that will join its B-Side coffee bar: the first Waikiki location of Redfish (the popular Honolulu spot known for its inventive poke bowls) and the poolside bar Lost + Found, which will focus on local microbrews and tropical cocktails.

That’s where the audience was supposed to sit, in the tunnels, unable to see much of anything. “American Moon” was a Happening, and Happenings were expected to look like they involved more dumpster-diving than rehearsal.

Eventually, after a wrong turn, they came upon a field, a few miles south of Tangier’s Moorish medinas, teeming with wild irises. Pasti has been fascinated by these flowers since childhood, and seeing acres and acres of their purple petals stirred him. “We’re home,” said Janson at the time.
