Their mission: to establish an experimental utopian community inspired by the economist Henry George, whose wildly popular book, “Progress and Poverty,” influenced readers around the world in search of more equitable societies. In this case, their chosen setting was a swath of pine- and pasture-covered land perched high on a bluff overlooking Mobile Bay. There, wrote one of the founders, Ernest B. Gaston, these pioneers would build “a city set upon a hill, shedding its beneficent light to all the world.” Somewhat more modestly, they christened their settlement Fairhope, asserting that their dream community would have “a fair hope” of succeeding.","A Southern Town That’s Been Holding On to Its Charm, for More Than a Century",2019-03-01T10:00:15+0000,article,Travel,News,"Travel and Vacations;Flagg, Fannie;FAIRHOPE (ALA)"

59,The writer Sabra Embury has spent a decade collecting 10-second drawings of rabbits from some of the most esteemed names in literature.,"I started this 10-second rabbit project a little over a decade ago as a way of channeling the artistic curiosity of the inspiring people around me. At parties I’d collect unsigned, loose-leaf doodles from people around a room, and then we’d guess who drew each based on our assumptions about one another. Like handwriting analysis, but with bunnies. Why bunnies? Because they’re tough to mistake for any other creature, thanks to the exaggerated stretch of their ears. They’re fun to draw even for people who possess no art skills at all. (Plus, imagine asking Jonathan Lethem to draw a chicken.) I later began asking authors at readings to sign their books with a rabbit, scrawled in 10 seconds or less. The time limit gave the whimsical scheme structure, and it also put participants at ease; I wasn’t asking for serious art. Still, they’d often protest, “I can’t draw!” before inevitably conceding, and eventually admitting they enjoyed the break from routinely asking to whom they should inscribe the book. Margaret Atwood, for one, embraced my request with a glow: “This is great!” she said, adding a carrot. Others (I’ve amassed 70 of these over the years), both reluctant and charmed, would sigh a “here goes” as I counted to 10.",See How Margaret Atwood and Jonathan Lethem and More Draw a Bunny,2019-03-01T10:00:18+0000,article,Books,News,Books and Literature

The third installment of the American series, “Rings” (2017), was a minor commercial success and a massive critical flop. For now, the franchise appears to be on pause.

No similar honor has been bestowed upon Basquiat by the City of New York. However, the opening of the Brant Foundation Art Study Center in the East Village, with an exhibition of nearly 70 works by Basquiat created from 1980 to 1987, serves as a fitting temporary shrine. The Brant in Manhattan is also part of a wave of private museums opening across the country, including the Hill Art Foundation in Chelsea; the expansion of Glenstone in Maryland; and the Marciano and Broad collections in Los Angeles.",‘Jean-Michel Basquiat’ at the Brant Shows His Bifurcated Life,2019-03-05T18:29:03+0000,article,Arts,Review,"Art;Brant Foundation Art Study Center;Finances;Basquiat, Jean-Michel;Museums;Race and Ethnicity;Glenstone (Potomac, Md);Guggenheim, Solomon R, Museum;Hill Art Foundation;Brant, Peter M;Parker, Charlie;Robinson, Sugar Ray;East Village (Manhattan, NY);Greenwich (Conn)"

644,A new wave of rose-quartz and jade tools focuses on a different type of manual massage to lift and sculpt your face.,"There are high-tech beauty devices — flashing LED-light firming masks, pH-measuring patches — and then there are the antitheses: simple stone tools that can stimulate circulation and impart a rested, youthful effect simply by being glided across the face (no plug required). Often cut from minerals such as jade and quartz, these implements have been used for centuries in Chinese medicine and represent the most basic form of natural skin care, says the New York City-based dermatologist Dr. Patricia Wexler. Lately, the options have expanded beyond the ubiquitous jade roller to include tools for gua sha, an ancient form of manual massage that involves “scraping” the edges of a flat stone along the meridians of the face with slow, firm movements. Doing so “can increase circulation, improve lymphatic drainage, de-puff eyes — and provide a calming effect,” says Dr. Wexler.

662,"As he prepares for a new solo exhibition in New York, Angel Otero looks back to his childhood home.","Dressed in all black, in contrast to the radiant colors that surround him, the artist Angel Otero emanates warmth as he stands in his studio in Bushwick, Brooklyn, right off the high-spirited Avenue of Puerto Rico (also known as Graham Avenue). His expansive high-ceilinged work space is currently occupied by a group of sprawling mixed-media paintings — made partly from collaged cutout pieces from his earlier works — that will soon depart for his coming exhibition, “Milagros,” at Lehmann Maupin gallery in Manhattan. The artist, too, is about to set out for a journey. Known for his visceral abstract oil paintings, Otero, 38, who has lived in New York for almost a decade, will open a second studio in his first home, Puerto Rico, early this summer. “I want to see what can happen if I am physically there, working and engaging with people,” he explains. “I’ve always been a loner and introvert while making art, and I want to break this habit there, and maybe even bring people into the studio to make art together.” He’s hopeful about the revitalization of the island after the devastation of Hurricane Maria in 2017. He believes good can come out of catastrophe, and adds: “A lot of young people are bringing amazing things back to the island. I want to be a part of this moment.”","A Brooklyn Artist Finds Inspiration, and Refuge, in Puerto Rico",2019-03-05T23:29:31+0000,article,T Magazine,News,Art;Lehmann Maupin Gallery;Puerto Rico;Brooklyn (NYC)

She had been the first woman to join the I.R.A. as a front-line soldier — leading bombing raids, targeting people for execution. She was a very dramatic, impetuous figure.” Keefe says he “was so intrigued by some of the details in the obituary that I wanted to see where they went.” Where they went, it turns out, is straight to the notorious 1972 kidnapping and murder of Jean McConville, a widowed Belfast mother of 10.",The Newest Trend in Children’s Lit: ‘Empathy Books’,2019-03-08T10:00:07+0000,article,Books,List,"Books and Literature;Say Nothing: A True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland (Book);Keefe, Patrick Radden;Say Something!

One woman began to crawl through the parted legs of another, as if a child at recess, while a third communed with the wall, splaying her limbs against its rust-colored surface. Warmed up, the class then made its way to the adjacent 1,800-square-foot redwood deck that Halprin’s late husband, the landscape architect Lawrence Halprin, built in 1952. Since its construction, artistic heirs of Halprin, including Simone Forti, Yvonne Rainer, Trisha Brown and Meredith Monk, have visited the deck at one time or another to practice and move with her. An esteemed teacher and performer, Halprin is known for her use of scores, or task-based improvisations, as well as for making dances inspired by nature.

The result is the Galop d’Hermès, a range of sleek women’s watches, in either steel or rose gold (inlaid diamonds optional), with a stirrup-shaped face inspired by the luxury brand’s equestrian heritage. Archibong, 35, originally trained as an architect but is now best known for his work as a furniture and lighting designer, creating sculptural glass pendant lamps and curvy steel chairs with chubby upholstered seats. Four years ago, when he met Philippe Delhotal — the creative director of Hermès Horloger, the Paris-based company’s watch division — his career took another unexpected turn. Delhotal invited Archibong, then a recent graduate of the prestigious L’École Cantonale d’Art de Lausanne in Switzerland, to create a timepiece for Hermès, and the designer subsequently spent time in the brand’s private archives outside of Paris before developing the Galop, whose case evokes the aerodynamic curves of a racehorse.","Designer Ini Archibong Shares a Glimpse Into His World, in Photographs",2019-03-21T15:33:49+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Design;Furniture;Hermes International SA;Archibong, Ini;Geneva (Switzerland);Paris (France)"
