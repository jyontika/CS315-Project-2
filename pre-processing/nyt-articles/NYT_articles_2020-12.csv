265,"With their cascades of white and yellow diamonds, these drop earrings conjure the woven, nubby quality of what was one of Coco Chanel’s favorite fabrics.","The joy of inversion animated the work of Gabrielle (Coco) Chanel, the eminent 20th-century couturier who never encountered a convention she didn’t want to subvert. Gender, especially, fascinated her. Liberating women from corsetry — putting them in trouser suits, chemises, short skirts and sporty leisure wear — radically advanced the course of modern feminism while making Chanel an international icon. But reimagining the shape of women’s clothing, and thus their silhouette in the world, was only one aspect of her revolutionary spirit: By purloining traditional men’s wear fabrics, she entirely upended notions of women as decorative and pliant. Tweed, developed as a humble workingman’s cloth in Scotland in the 1700s and adopted a century later by the duck-hunting English upper class, ranked among her favorite textiles. In the 1950s, she introduced the nubby skirt suit in Linton tweed, variations of which are still a signature style of the house that bears her name. Now, Chanel has developed a new 45-piece high jewelry collection that uses an interwoven articulation of precious metals and stones to evoke the earthiness of that material. With a cascade of white and yellow diamonds in an encyclopedic variety of cuts and sizes, these dangling earrings conjure the informal, unpretentious warp and weft that captured the designer’s renegade imagination so many years ago.","Glittering High Jewelry, Inspired by Tweed",2020-12-02T15:00:06+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Chanel SA;Chanel, Coco;Jewels and Jewelry;Textiles;Fashion and Apparel"

450,"The public shaming of those deemed moral transgressors has been around for ages.

(In English, the nuances are lost; no zombie inflection was intended.) A request would go out for wangmin (web citizens), or in this case the more intimate wangyou (web friends, internet users sharing a common passion or cause), to come together as a kind of ad hoc detective agency in order to ferret out information about objects and figures of interest. It was just an outlet for fandom. But soon attention turned toward supposed wrongdoers, those thought to exhibit moral deficiency, from a low-level government official spotted flashing a designer watch far above his pay grade, hinting at corruption, to, more horrifically, a woman in a “crush video” — a fringe genre of erotica that traffics in animal cruelty — wielding stilettos to stomp a kitten to death.

462,Van Cleef & Arpels has been creating convertible jewelry for decades. One of its latest pieces features a detachable pendant and brooch.,"When the Great Depression took hold in the early 1930s, fine jewelers scrambled to make their extravagant wares seem if not utilitarian at least a bit more versatile. Who needed a ball-worthy diadem that sat in a velvet box for much of the year, or an unwieldy cocktail ring? And so along came convertible jewelry — a single piece that could be configured in multiple ways. The most famous of these was Van Cleef & Arpels’s Zip necklace, with diamond teeth that could be zipped up to become a bracelet. The Surrealist design was suggested to the jeweler by Wallis Simpson, the Duchess of Windsor, in 1938 after one of Simpson’s favorite couturiers, Elsa Schiaparelli, began to use the newfangled fastener on her designs instead of buttons. Today, the Paris-based house continues to experiment with such chameleonic creations, most recently this massive articulated collar with a detachable pendant and brooch. Adorned with more than 60 large rubies and a veritable mine of white diamonds, the two roses, which can be worn together as a clip, were fashioned by a proprietary method in which stones are set almost invisibly in a sculpturelike armature. The monumental piece, whether pinned to a lapel or draped around the neck, may not be built for practicality this time around, but it surely illustrates the beauty of always remaining adaptable.",A Necklace That Highlights the Beauty in Versatility,2020-12-03T15:00:07+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Van Cleef & Arpels;Jewels and Jewelry;Wallis, Duchess of Windsor;Diamonds"

Westerners have never quite understood the reverence in Japan for fugu, alternately known in English as puffer fish, globefish or blowfish, of the family Tetraodontidae.

Among those who think of fugu as merely a distant delicacy, knowledge rarely goes beyond the fish’s infamous trait: In the most delicious species, the innards are suffused with the neurotoxin called tetrodotoxin (TTX).

For now, while the restaurant waits for gas for cooking, it’s more generally American and European. Though the chef, Kamal Hoyte, a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America, is from St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and has never been to Slovenia, the owner, Dean O’Neill, an experienced restaurateur and restaurant designer, has had business interests there since 2003. The two have been working together on this project for more than a year. Mr. O’Neill has also recruited Alma Rekic, a pastry chef from Slovenia, to consult on the mostly traditional sweets and her baked apple rolls, a Slovene item already on the menu. Mr. Hoyte’s food, described as Slovene-American, also reflects his background working in restaurants like Daniel: His Slovene fish stew will come with aioli, bouillabaisse-style. The restaurant is on two floors, and the lower level will have four private party areas to open in coming months. Street level is where the public dining is, in two rooms, one with exposed brick, a marble bar and assorted chandeliers. The name of the restaurant means bakery in Slovene; the space once housed a bakery.","Pekarna Opens, Featuring the Cuisine of Slovenia",2020-12-08T19:11:03+0000,article,Food,News,Restaurants;Seafood;Manhattan (NYC);Brooklyn (NYC)

2038,A blend from Stone Street Coffee that has been a favorite at Le Bernardin is now available to the public.,"Coffee is one of the most complicated comestibles: variables include type of bean, its source, the roast, the grind, the brewing method and how it’s served. Find a coffee that delivers pleasure without much decision-making and you become a loyal fan. The Central and South American blend of coffee from Stone Street Coffee, a Brooklyn importer and roaster, is just such a brew. The medium-roast coffee is smooth and balanced, with a touch of mocha sweetness and lively tang whether brewed for espresso, French press or pour-over. These characteristics even held for the decaf version. Eric Ripert, the chef and an owner of Le Bernardin, said he had tasted Stone Street Coffee back in 2016 and was smitten. He then began working with Johan Pesenti, the owner of Stone Street, to develop a blend for the restaurant, where it has been served for the past year. Now it is also sold for home use, whole bean and ground (press, drip and espresso). It’s organic and kosher.",Eric Ripert Lends His Name to a Coffee,2020-12-15T01:37:11+0000,article,Food,News,"Coffee;Ripert, Eric;Restaurants"

It was 3 in the afternoon his time, in Paris, where he keeps a small apartment at Les Récollets, a Franciscan friary built in 1603 and converted four centuries later into housing for visiting artists and scholars. Wiseman’s home — and wife, Zipporah, and production company, also named Zipporah — all remain in Cambridge, Mass.

In mid-March, he finished the sound mix for “City Hall,” his 45th feature, just as Emmanuel Macron announced a national lockdown. As fall arrived, with his new four-and-a-half-hour documentary opening at largely virtual film festivals (Venice, New York, Toronto) to rapturous reviews, Wiseman, who in a normal year would have walked one or more of the red carpets, remained sidelined in France, thousands of miles from his family and unable to begin his next project. It was the first time in 55 years he hadn’t been working on a film, Wiseman told me. When I asked how he’d been holding up, he noted flatly, “Well, in addition to being scared, I’m bored.” His doctors had advised him not to fly, “primarily,” he said, “because I’m of the age Covid likes.” Wiseman will celebrate his 91st birthday on New Year’s Day.",What if the Great American Novelist Doesn’t Write Novels?,2020-12-15T10:00:05+0000,article,Magazine,News,"Wiseman, Frederick;Documentary Films and Programs;Content Type: Personal Profile;Politics and Government;Books and Literature"

2697,"Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times, discusses where “Caliphate” failed to meet Times standards. And Mark Mazzetti, an investigative correspondent for The Times, details new reporting that casts significant doubt on the claims of a central figure in the series.","Editors’ Note [Dec. 18, 2020]: In 2018, The Times released a 12-part narrative podcast series called “Caliphate” on the Islamic State terrorist group and its operations. While parts of the series involved a broad examination of the group’s tactics and influence, multiple episodes were driven primarily by the confessional tale of a Canadian man of Pakistani origin who called himself Abu Huzayfah and claimed to have been a member of the Islamic State who had taken part in killings in Syria.During the course of reporting for the series, The Times discovered significant falsehoods and other discrepancies in Huzayfah’s story. The Times took a number of steps, including seeking confirmation of details from intelligence officials in the United States, to find independent evidence of Huzayfah’s story. The decision was made to proceed with the project but to include an episode, Chapter 6, devoted to exploring major discrepancies and highlighting the fact-checking process that sought to verify key elements of the narrative. In September — two and a half years after the podcast was released — the Canadian police arrested Huzayfah, whose real name is Shehroze Chaudhry, and charged him with perpetrating a terrorist hoax. Canadian officials say they believe that Mr. Chaudhry’s account of supposed terrorist activity is completely fabricated. The hoax charge led The Times to investigate what Canadian officials had discovered, and to re-examine Mr. Chaudhry’s account and the earlier efforts to determine its validity. This new examination found a history of misrepresentations by Mr. Chaudhry and no corroboration that he committed the atrocities he described in the “Caliphate” podcast.As a result, The Times has concluded that the episodes of “Caliphate” that presented Mr. Chaudhry’s claims did not meet our standards for accuracy.From the outset, “Caliphate” should have had the regular participation of an editor experienced in the subject matter. In addition, The Times should have pressed harder to verify Mr. Chaudhry’s claims before deciding to place so much emphasis on one individual’s account. For example, reporters and editors could have vetted more thoroughly materials Mr. Chaudhry provided for evidence that he had traveled to Syria to join the Islamic State, and pushed harder and earlier to determine what the authorities knew about him. It is also clear that elements of the original fact-checking process were not sufficiently rigorous: Times journalists were too credulous about the verification steps that were undertaken and dismissive of the lack of corroboration of essential aspects of Mr. Chaudhry’s account. In the absence of firmer evidence, “Caliphate” should have been substantially revised to exclude the material related to Mr. Chaudhry. The podcast as a whole should not have been produced with Mr. Chaudhry as a central narrative character.A fuller description of what The Times has learned about Mr. Chaudhry was published on Dec. 18, 2020.

This got me thinking about what my own bare-minimum criteria for poetry might be. A bag of dirt in a gallery might be an installation, but I wasn’t quite willing to concede it could also be a poem — a poem must at least, on some level, I thought, be verbal. But was that quite right? What about Aram Saroyan’s famous visual poems, in particular the lowercase m with an extra hump — not even a word or part of a word; an unletter. Maybe poetry only requires typography — but doesn’t it also require sound, the sense that at least in theory you could hear the poem? I do feel I can “read” that long m — it has a sonic quality — and the Saroyan poem “lighght.” An ampersand alone on a page would represent a pronounceable word.

He still barely knew the university presidents and chancellors, who hired him, or the athletic directors.

4140,A new group of small-batch beauty companies is continuing the region’s storied tradition of organic growing and local sourcing.,"In certain parts of Northern California, cultivating edible plants — beets, rosemary, kale, lavender — is so central to the lifestyle that, as the Marin County resident Claudia Mata puts it, “It’s a rarity to find someone who isn’t growing their own food or herbs in their backyard.” With its moderate oceanic climate, nutrient-rich soil and free-spirited hippie vibes, the area — which extends roughly from Monterey to Siskiyou County — has long been fertile ground for landmark food and agricultural movements: organic farming in the 1940s, winemaking in the 1960s, farm-to-table cooking in the 1970s. More recently, it has also fostered an influential community of beauty entrepreneurs. Since at least the early aughts, plant-based brands have thrived in the region, offering potent formulas derived from homegrown ingredients and produced in small batches with minimal preservatives. Such principles, coupled with increasing and widespread interest in the kind of holistic living that many Northern Californians have been practicing for decades, have paved the way for today’s larger clean-beauty boom.","From Northern California, Farm-Fresh Skin Care",2020-12-31T16:40:50+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Skin;Cosmetics and Toiletries;Beauty (Concept);Earth Tu Face Inc;Vintner's Daughter;Waters, Alice;California;Berkeley (Calif);Marin County (Calif);San Francisco Bay Area (Calif)"
