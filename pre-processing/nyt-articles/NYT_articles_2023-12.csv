In 1986, across the avenue at Lafayette in the Drake Hotel, was where New York first noticed him; Bryan Miller awarded Lafayette four stars in The New York Times two years later. Scores of restaurants and decades later, at Four Twenty Five, Mr. Vongerichten is relying on a seasoned veteran, Jonathan Benno, who was the chef de cuisine at Thomas Keller’s Per Se and the executive chef at Lincoln Ristorante before having his own place in NoMad. The menu in the new restaurant is à la carte and seasonal. January, not July, comes to mind with Nantucket bay scallop tartare; tricolor cauliflower; chicory salad with walnuts and pears; winter squash agnolotti with brown butter vinaigrette; a main dish of celery root done francese-style; pan-roasted steelhead trout with pumpkin seed gremolata and roasted squash; chicken breast cloaked in black truffle crumbs and served with black truffle butter; and charred duck breast with roasted cabbage. There’s also a seven-course tasting. Some dishes, notably the pastas and crudos, announce Mr. Benno, while others, like steamed black sea bass with winter mushrooms, are clearly from Mr. Vongerichten’s portfolio. “Black sea bass is the best fish in America,” he said. The 84-seat restaurant, designed by Norman Foster (like the building that houses it), is on the second floor, softly done in tones of gray and burgundy, with a gleaming kitchen behind a wall of glass, and a soaring ceiling. There’s a bar on the ground floor, with a vibrant Larry Poons painting above it, where small plates like sliders and chicken samosas will be served. Through the end of the year it will be dinner only, with lunch to follow next month, and eventually breakfast.

699,"For centuries, labor was deemed too messy a subject for gallery walls. A growing canon of feminist work is challenging that perception.","Not long after completing “The Dinner Party” (1974-79), her monumental installation dedicated to historical women, the artist Judy Chicago began researching depictions of birth in Western art — only to discover there were almost none. “If men had babies, there would be thousands of images of the crowning,” she said. In an effort to fill this void, she went straight to the source. She witnessed a live birth — the San Francisco-based designer Karin Hibma agreed to let Chicago sketch in the delivery room — and sent detailed questionnaires to more than 100 mothers. (Sample questions: Why did you want to have a baby? What physical changes have become permanent?) Part of her resulting work, “The Birth Project” series (1980-85), made up of painted, woven and embroidered images of women in labor, is currently on view at Chicago’s retrospective at the New Museum in New York. Many of the images are epic in tone and size: Breasts become mountains and rivers flow from between open legs. Chicago was, as she later wrote, “building a form language almost ‘from scratch,’” one that linked the act of birth to divine creation. But to this day, according to Massimiliano Gioni, one of the show’s curators, the series has never been shown in full.",How Artists Are Breaking the Taboos Around Depicting Birth,2023-12-06T15:20:15+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Art;Women and Girls;Pregnancy and Childbirth;Photography;Women's Rights;Chicago, Judy;McNeely, Juanita (1936- );Shin, Heji (1976- )"

The 145-minute film by Tran An Hung, starring Juliette Binoche and Benoit Magimel, is based on the 1920 novel “The Life and Passion of Dodin-Bouffant, Gourmet” by Marcel Rouff, inspired by the French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, who gave his name to a cheese and a cake. The film is set at a modest château in the Loire region, the centerpiece of which is the robust kitchen where Dodin-Bouffant and his cook, Eugénie, prepare sumptuous meal after meal for Dodin’s small coterie of gourmands, as their own love story gently simmers. The pièce de résistance is a classic pot-au-feu. The chef Pierre Gagnaire was the consultant for the cooking, and in an interview in New York he said “everything is real; there was no faking.” (Not quite: There was backup gas fuel for the wood-burning stove, and small quail stood in for ortolans, a delicacy that is illegal.) He said the stars knew how to cook and “jumped right in.” Ms. Binoche told me that the food “haute cuisine but not pretentious.”  From Dec. 13 through 20, there will be a menu at Frenchette, in TriBeCa, with three dishes from “The Taste of Things”: a ballotine of duck, pot-au-feu and baked Alaska ($90 or à la carte).

In a show of extreme confidence, it’s the only product sold in the bright white shop of the same name he owns with Edward Geyman, his business partner. A native of the Burgundy region in France who studied pastry-making and has been a pastry consultant in many countries around the globe, Mr. Doyen, 38, arrived in the United States a year ago and began working on this project. “I didn’t just want to reproduce French pastry,” he said. The flavor and filling combinations are endless. For now he has eight colorful examples, including peanut butter and jelly, matcha with white chocolate, walnut with dark chocolate, red velvet with dark chocolate and raspberry, and pecan caramel with milk chocolate chips and sea salt. He has a featured flavor of the month, which for now is s’mores with a marshmallow topping that he torches before serving. He said he’s working on a mini size.","You Know the Cronut.

2808,This week’s picks involve artificial youth and alien-discovering elders.,"This thoughtful release is the latest in a long — and ever-growing — line of science-fiction movies considering whether or not artificial intelligence can develop self-awareness and feelings. Directed by a filmmaking duo calling itself hazart, “A Hard Problem” looks at what it means to be alive — which, naturally, also involves what it means to cease to exist. Ian (Johnny Berchtold), after the death of his mother, Mary (Jennifer Pierce Mathus), is left to sort her belongings. The willowy young man is adrift and forlorn, which seems like a legitimate response, but actually isn’t: He’s a synthetic “artificial parallel” of the actual Ian, who died of cancer, and was created to assuage Mary’s grief. Logically, Ian should be taken out of commission since his purpose is gone. But gradually both he and Olivia (Catherine Haena Kim), a representative of the company that built him, realize that shutting down a parallel is more fraught than turning off an appliance.
