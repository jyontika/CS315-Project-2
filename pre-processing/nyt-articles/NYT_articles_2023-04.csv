360,The author of “Rent Boy” and “Do Everything in the Dark” reflects on a life of writing and art.,"Gary Indiana is the author of eight novels and hundreds of essays that revel in the seedier depravities of American decline: murder, fraud, incest, obsession. In his 1989 debut, “Horse Crazy,” Indiana revives Thomas Mann’s “Death in Venice” (1912) in Lower Manhattan, where a writer not unlike the author falls for a young artist who may or may not be hustling him. His trilogy of crime novels, “Resentment” (1997), “Three Month Fever” (1999) and “Depraved Indifference” (2002), borrows material from the high-profile murder cases of the Menendez Brothers; Andrew Cunanan (who killed Gianni Versace); and the grifter Sante Kimes, elevating the New Journalism of Truman Capote and Norman Mailer to postmodern carnivalesque. For much of his career, aside from a brief stint in semi-obscure prominence as the staff art critic of The Village Voice from 1985 to 1988, Indiana’s writing has eluded the attention of the mainstream literary establishment. But at 72, he has found a new audience. In May, Semiotext(e) will reissue “Do Everything in the Dark” (2003), Indiana’s mordant depiction of the New York art world aging into a new millennium, and “Rent Boy” (1994), his noir about a male prostitute who becomes an unwitting accomplice to an organ harvesting scheme, was brought back into print by McNally Editions in January.

But the city is a past-tense place. The present of the poet is in the desert, where a newfound stillness issues its own stark reply.

Following Ryusuke Hamaguchi’s Oscar-winning film “Drive My Car” — also based on an amalgamation of Murakami works — Földes’s effort skews more faithfully to the author’s inscrutable style, combining surrealist narratives with a pensive tone that can be hard to pin down.

1532,This documentary looks at the efforts of Kristine McDivitt Tompkins and Douglas Tompkins to preserve stretches of land in Argentina and Chile.,"“Wild Life,” the latest eco-conscious documentary from the filmmakers Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (“Free Solo,” “Meru”) is a rickety helicopter tour of a fascinating marriage; nearly every scene makes you want to stop and explore in more detail.

The scale of the couple’s ambition teeters on the surreal. Asked in archival footage about a massive snow-flocked volcano on the horizon, Doug casually replies, “Yeah, that came with it.”",‘Wild Life’ Review: Their Land Is Our Land,2023-04-13T16:52:07+0000,article,Movies,Review,"Documentary Films and Programs;Philanthropy;Conservation of Resources;National Parks, Monuments and Seashores;Content Type: Personal Profile;Mountaineering;Wild Life (Movie);Chin, Jimmy (1973- );Vasarhelyi, Elizabeth Chai;Tompkins, Kristine;Tompkins, Douglas (1943- );ARGENTINA;Chile;Patagonia (Chile);Esprit Holdings Ltd;Patagonia (Argentina)"

And this week marks the arrival of a sensational place to stay: the 11-room Villa Inkognito in Oslo’s elegant Frogner neighborhood. A black-and-white entrance hall gives way to colorful public spaces, making plain that its interior designers — Adam Greco and Alice Lund, the duo behind the studio GrecoDeco — had fun as they updated the former residence from the 1870s. Every room is a joyful mash up of historically inspired wallpapers, jewel-toned painted walls, wood paneling and a mix of antique and custom-designed furniture. “We wanted to keep some of its original Victorian-style interiors but also add some inspiration from other design movements at that time: Art Nouveau, English Arts and Crafts movement and the trend of collecting objects from Asia,” says Greco. Although the Villa is technically part of the eight-month-old Sommerro hotel (the main building, also designed by GrecoDeco, houses 231 rooms with an Art Deco public bath and swimming pool) and is connected to it by a discreet walkway, it was designed to be its own intimate space with access to a private kitchen and chef. The ground floor is made up of common rooms including Spectre, an honesty bar with silver gilded walls and tiles of salvaged golden onyx. Greco hopes that guests feel like they’re “staying in an eccentric private mansion.” From $615 a night, villainkognito.com.",A Mexican Boutique With Penguin Saltshakers and Nopal Coin Purses,2023-04-19T20:31:04+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Cherkassky, Zoya;Hotels and Travel Lodgings;Art;Dolce & Gabbana;Bars and Nightclubs;Interior Design and Furnishings"

2352,The question of death is met with the sweet bewilderment of a poet,"Lewis Freedman’s “I Want Something Other Than Time” is one of dozens of poems with this same title, published in his book of the same name.

Each poem also has a metaphysical fixation, performing a sticky reckoning with questions of being and time, enacted in language that travels swiftly and surprisingly between the casual and the philosophical. In this iteration, it is the question of death — and its seemingly indefatigable forces, “the death guys” — that is met with the sweet bewilderment of a poet.

2401,Jake Gyllenhaal stars in this furious and discomfiting war film that tugs on your conscience for days.,"“Guy Ritchie’s The Covenant,” the saga of a U.S. sergeant (Jake Gyllenhaal) honor-bound to his Afghan interpreter (Dar Salim), starts like most other movies about the ultimately unsuccessful 20-year effort to suppress the Taliban.

Sincerity is an unusual tone for its director, Guy Ritchie, who specializes in laddish shoot-’em-ups. Here, Ritchie is not just earnest — he’s morally outraged about the broken promises made to thousands of Afghans who believed they’d earned Special Immigrant Visas only to be abandoned to fend for themselves. For all its clichés, this furious and discomfiting film tugs on your conscience for days, making a powerful case to turn the American public’s attention back to a conflict it would rather forget.",‘Guy Ritchie’s The Covenant’ Review: Call of Duty,2023-04-20T11:00:06+0000,article,Movies,Review,"Movies;Ritchie, Guy;Gyllenhaal, Jake;Guy Ritchie's The Covenant (Movie);Salim, Dar (1977- )"

3328,The summery staples and personalized pieces that T Magazine’s editors and contributors are eyeing for our own maternal figures.,"A good, stiff martini is a gift unto itself. And now, it’s one you can wrap in shiny paper and top with a bow, as the glassware designed to cradle an icy gin elixir reaches peak allure. Some, like these Helle Mardahl ones with lime green feet, are irreverent; others, like the Sophie Lou Jacobsen Piano line, bring retro energy to happy hour. The sturdy Totem glasses, also by Jacobsen, would wink winningly at your mother from any bar cart, beckoning her over for a nightcap; these coupes atop columns from Ichendorf Milano might serve her better at the beginning of an evening, alongside that fussy china you’re glad she’s stored so meticulously since her wedding, even if she won’t tell you which sibling it’ll go to. Giftees who like to pace themselves might appreciate the opportunity to do so gracefully with these shallow Coupes de Pompadour by the Amsterdam-based designer Boris de Beijer. To make a full martini-themed package, look to vintage sites like Chairish and 1st Dibs for antique shaker finds like this J.A.

The move came less than a week after the company paid $787.5 million to settle a defamation suit with Dominion Voting Systems. A focus of the case had been Mr. Carlson’s texts, showing him denigrating Donald J. Trump after the 2020 presidential election. But it wasn’t until the day before the defamation trial was to begin that Fox leadership discovered private messages sent by Mr. Carlson that had been redacted in previous legal filings showing him making highly offensive and crude remarks. Those messages served as a catalyst for his firing, several people with knowledge of Fox’s discussions said. Soon after Mr. Carlson was fired, CNN announced that it had “parted ways” with Don Lemon, a longtime star on the network who most recently was a morning show co-host.

They climb into an impossibly small car, and Ted calls out to Rebecca, his serious, conniving new boss, “Look! This car has an invisible steering wheel!,” mimicking steering on the left side of the car (as we do on this side of the pond).
