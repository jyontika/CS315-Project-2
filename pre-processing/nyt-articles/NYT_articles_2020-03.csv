Fans of elaborate scavenger hunts would get a kick of out this new anthology series. The idea came to Jason Segel, the show’s creator and star, after he discovered an art project and immersive game that drew more than 7,000 people in San Francisco and Oakland from 2008 to 2011. He adapted it for the screen and plays one of four characters (along with Sally Field, André Benjamin and Eve Lindley) who are brought together by what is, at the outset, to some a practical joke and to others a global conspiracy. There’s an element of growth here: Along the way, the journey helps participants overcome inner battles. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Segel said the show celebrates regular people. “A lot of stories are about someone finding out that they’re extraordinary,” he said. “And this whole thing, it’s this idea that we can all be ordinary together and that it’s beautiful.”",What’s on TV Sunday: ‘Dispatches from Elsewhere’ and ‘Doctor Who’,2020-03-01T06:00:05+0000,article,Arts,News,Movies;Television

Alice Notley’s best work feels this way: intensely recursive, almost too good to read.

The architect David Rockwell’s company, the Rockwell Group, has given the space a richly elegant but subdued look with shades of gray as the dominant palette. The Peak experience involves entering through a dim, plush lounge for cocktails and bar snacks on the fifth floor of Hudson Yards’s retail building. From there, an elevator speeds up and docks at a spacious lobby, with the restaurant to one side and private dining rooms and an event space opposite. The restaurant dips gradually from a curved, brass-trimmed 45-seat bar area to a 110-seat dining room, where sculptural light sticks hang from the ceiling and bare tables on a few levels afford views like a bird’s-eye of the Empire State Building. Does it remind you of Windows on the World? Of course, but with less grandeur and gilt. The restaurant is run by RHC, the English company that also manages Wild Ink in Hudson Yards. The executive chef, Christopher Cryer, who was in that role at the Seamore’s seafood restaurants, has created a fairly brief menu of sophisticated yet accessible American fare like Atlantic scallops with cauliflower purée, beef tartare, rigatoni with lamb sausages, roasted monkfish with littleneck clams, cauliflower steak, braised short rib, rotisserie chicken and a fried potato terrine.

447,Two new comedy series — BET’s “Twenties” and FXX’s “Dave” — follow creative protagonists building careers.,"TWENTIES 10 p.m. on BET. After Lena Waithe’s groundbreaking 2017 Emmy win — in which she became the first African-American woman to receive an Emmy for outstanding writing in a comedy series — the filmmaker Ava DuVernay posted to social media a photograph of a young Waithe balancing trays of coffee in the back seat of a car. It was a throwback to Waithe’s early career, in which she was an assistant to people in Hollywood, including DuVernay. That period of Waithe’s life provides the basis for her new, semi-autobiographical comedy series, “Twenties,” which centers on a 24-year-old aspiring television writer, Hattie (Jonica T. Gibbs) — though it moves the action to the present day. “This is our world post my character on ‘Master of None;’ it’s a world post ‘Get Out’; it’s a world post ‘Moonlight,’” Waithe said of the show in a recent interview with The New York Times. “This is the first time a masculine-of-center black woman has been the center of a show on prime-time TV.”",What’s on TV Wednesday: ‘Twenties’ and ‘Dave’,2020-03-04T06:00:07+0000,article,Arts,News,Television;Movies

Not less attractive—if anything, more so—but also not quite like the man I’d married not so long ago. His chin was slack. His brow furrowed with some small concern. I rubbed my eyes. Misha was older than I was by only a few months, but in that moment it seemed a whole decade had intervened. I reached out to touch his cheek across a stretch of time.

The documentary places interviews with Bill Clinton and the journalist Joe Klein, among others, alongside archival footage, thought it’s built largely around Burstein’s interviews with Clinton herself. The first question: “Do you feel frustrated that you’ve been in public life for 30 years, yet people feel that they don’t know who you are, that you seem inauthentic?” (It surely can’t be a spoiler to reveal that Clinton’s answer is yes.)",What’s on TV Friday: ‘Hillary’ and ‘Spenser Confidential’,2020-03-06T08:00:06+0000,article,Arts,News,Television;Movies

1288,A new vegan deli product mimics the flavor of the Reuben staple.,"There’s a new player on the mock-meat front: vegan corned beef. Jenny Goldfarb, a vegan for nearly 10 years whose family was in the Jewish deli business in New York, decided that the taste of a hefty corned beef sandwich or a Reuben should not be on vegans’ no-fly list. She spent months in her kitchen experimenting with wheat, chickpeas, beets, tomatoes, spices, sweeteners and yeast, and finally, in 2018, began introducing the results in Los Angeles. Sarge’s Delicatessen & Diner in New York started serving her Mrs. Goldfarb’s Unreal Deli Corned Beef in January. It’s increasingly sold nationwide. The “meat” approximates the slightly crumbly texture of the real thing fairly well, and delivers its salty, somewhat smoky flavor. (It’s also kosher.) It’s a true departure from the usual burgers and sausages that vegan meat mimics. But what’s missing is the fat, especially for those, like me, who do not prefer lean corned beef. Thus, it’s best in a sandwich dressed with mustard and coleslaw or in a Reuben, in the company of gooey Russian dressing, melting vegan cheese and a moist layer of sauerkraut.","Corned Beef, Hold the Beef",2020-03-09T20:43:52+0000,article,Food,News,Veganism;Delicatessens

1418,"Zenith’s El Primero was once considered a mechanical marvel. Now, it’s achieved cult classic status.","The world’s first high-frequency automatic chronograph was introduced in 1969 by Zenith, a Swiss watchmaker founded more than a century before in the town of Le Locle. Unrivaled in timing precision (to one-tenth of a second) with a barrel-shaped tonneau case displaying a round dial with three charcoal-tinted subdials, the El Primero was considered a mechanical marvel; its chronograph module used an entirely integrated caliber, not just one bolted to an existing automatic movement. But the El Primero wasn’t on top for long: Just a few years later, quartz — an element that enabled watches to tell time even more accurately — threatened to make mechanical watches obsolete. Luckily, Zenith’s chronograph, along with the company, was saved when, in 1988, Rolex used the elegantly slender, self-winding caliber to power an updated version of its classic Daytona, which turned the movement into a cult favorite. Fifty years after El Primero’s debut, the company has released a timepiece that pays homage to the original 1969 model. Just two small tweaks were needed to bring it into the present: The hollow links of the original bracelet designed by the renowned Geneva firm Gay Frères have been rendered in solid steel; and there’s now a sapphire crystal caseback, the better to fixate endlessly on a timepiece that helped fine horology take a leap into the future. $8,200, zenith-watches.com.",A Watch Brought Back From the Brink of Extinction,2020-03-10T15:00:04+0000,article,T Magazine,News,Watches and Clocks;Rolex SA;Zenith SA;Switzerland

So he has now become a hammelier and opened his own spot, a sliver of brick walls and mirrors with just 20 seats in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens, Brooklyn, where he lives with his wife, Phoebe Damrosch, a writer and a partner in the restaurant, and their four sons. They have at least 11 American cured heritage-breed hams on the menu. Some are from venerable producers that have been curing hams for 100 years or more, and others are the work of newcomers. Many of the hams are from Kentucky, and some, like the ruddy Dakota, are on a more-or-less exclusive basis. The chef Cesare Casella’s prosciutto from upstate New York also gets its turn on the vintage slicer. Cornmeal madeleines and American cheeses are served, and Mr. Mack limits his wines to American selections. “I have about 320 labels, many from vintages going back to the 1970s and ’80s,” he said. He grew up in Texas, and began his wine career at the French Laundry. He went on to work at Per Se, and left to start making his own wine, which he still does, with Maison Noir Wines, in Oregon. He also runs a wine shop, VyneYard, nearby. In a few months, he plans a retail shop, & Sons Buttery, selling hams, cheeses, condiments and table accessories, next door to the restaurant.","& Sons, a Sommelier’s Ham Bar, Opens in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens",2020-03-11T17:03:53+0000,article,Food,News,"Restaurants;Feinstein's/54 Below (Manhattan, NY, Music Venue);& Sons (Brooklyn, NY, Restaurant)"

1705,A drama about the Manson cult airs on Showtime. And the Dixie Chicks perform on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.”,"CHARLIE SAYS (2019) 9 p.m. on Showtime. Mary Harron vacillates between prison and movie ranch in “Charlie Says,” her drama about the Charles Manson cult. Though she is best known as the director of the satirical serial-killer study “American Psycho,” Harron here pays relatively little attention to Manson himself (played by Matt Smith), instead focusing on three of his female followers (played by Hannah Murray, Marianne Rendón and Sosie Bacon). That trio tells the story here. The movie shows them both during their time with Manson and after the fact, in prison, where they recount their story to a graduate student (Karlene Faith, played by Merritt Wever). “It’s a tough, difficult story that, anchored by Guinevere Turner’s script, Harron recounts with lucid calm, compassion and intelligent interpretive license,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. “She revisits some of the familiar locations, including the dusty California ranch where the Manson family set up house, and she carefully restages some of the murders. For those familiar with the horrific details of those crimes, the movie may seem wholly uninviting, but bear with Harron — she has something to say.”",What’s on TV Thursday: ‘Charlie Says’ and the Dixie Chicks,2020-03-12T05:00:06+0000,article,Arts,News,Television;Movies

2413,Cartier’s new Mauna necklace channels the combination of restraint and radiant excess brought to the house by the jewelry designer Jeanne Toussaint.,"When the designer Jeanne Toussaint, known for both her lithe, turbaned elegance and her lasting friendship with Coco Chanel, was named by Louis Cartier as head of jewelry design at his family-run company in 1933, her restrained yet vibrant pieces came to define a new era of Art Deco abstraction. While later she became known for her realistic depictions of flowers and animals, especially the house’s now iconic panther (her nick­name was La Panthère), in the early years, she explored geometric form and unusual gems. Among them was the rare pinkish-orange imperial topaz, mined in the 19th century in western Russia’s Ural Mountains, when only the czar’s family were allowed to wear the stones. This new necklace features three exquisite imperial topazes from Brazil, including a dangling 11-carat pear-cut bicolor stone with an ombré effect that shifts from fuchsia to Tuscan yellow. Set off by diamonds, colored sapphires and rutilated quartz prized for its slash-like inclusions, it evokes Toussaint’s combustible combination of classical discipline and modern exuberance.

America’s speed-reading obsession confounds Schotter; on average, people read twice as fast as they can comfortably listen.

2938,A coming-of-age movie with Pete Davidson is on Hulu. And the comedian Mae Martin stars in a new series on Netflix.,"BIG TIME ADOLESCENCE (2020) Stream on Hulu. Pete Davidson plays a role model with platinum blond hair and a taste for weed in this coarse coming-of-age comedy, the debut film of the writer-director Jason Orley. The plot centers on a brotherly relationship between Davidson’s character, a 23-year-old named Zeke, and Mo (Griffin Gluck), his ex-girlfriend’s 16-year-old younger brother, whom he walks through the finer points of the suburban slacker lifestyle. The story also involves small-time drug dealing and Mo’s pursuit of a crush (played by Oona Laurence). “Though Davidson, Gluck and Laurence show star potential, Orley either boxes them into a too-conventional coming-of-age arc or gives them cloyingly charming characteristics,” Kristen Yoonsoo Kim wrote in her review for The New York Times. “Despite some moments of tenderness and easy chemistry between Zeke and Mo,” Kim added, “‘Big Time Adolescence’ doesn’t have enough heart or humor to save it from becoming just another movie about white dudes bro-ing out.”",What’s on TV Thursday: ‘Big Time Adolescence’ and ‘Feel Good’,2020-03-19T05:00:06+0000,article,Arts,News,Television;Movies

Anthony Mackie and Samuel L. Jackson play men who join forces to subvert discriminatory housing practices in this historical drama. Set primarily before the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the film begins by introducing Bernard S. Garrett (Mackie), an African-American entrepreneur who moves to Los Angeles along with his wife, Eunice (Nia Long). There, Bernard meets Joe Morris (Jackson), a club owner with whom he teams up on an admirable scheme: Buying homes in white areas and renting them out to members of the city’s black middle class. They do that with the help of a somewhat guileless white colleague (played by Nicholas Hoult). The characters are based on real people. “It’s hard not to root for them even if they’re obvious and underdeveloped, burdened with dialogue that too often sounds programmatic rather than embodied,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. The film, Dargis wrote, “uses laughs, white racism and black righteousness to soft-sell a tale of inequality, heroic capitalism and eye-drooping mathematics.”",What’s on TV Friday: ‘The Banker’ and ‘Blow the Man Down’,2020-03-20T05:00:06+0000,article,Arts,News,Television;Movies

His interest in Memphis — a design collective formed in 1981 that placed an emphasis on bold colors and wild abstraction — stems in part from a fascination with the boundary-pushing aesthetics of that decade. In particular, Kirkwood is drawn to the graphic glass vases made by Ettore Sottsass, the Italian industrial designer and father of the postmodernist movement. “I found my first Sottsass vase about six years ago in Paris,” he says. “I was struck by its shape and color — it resembled something a child might build.” Since then, the 39-year-old has amassed a collection of over a dozen vases. Several are assembled on a windowsill in his Soho studio to catch the light, and a few contain the sculptural flower arrangements he prefers from London’s Fjura. “Sottsass pieces may not be practical or classically beautiful, but they can really hold a room,” says the designer, whose spring collection is inspired by the relationship between architecture and nature in Los Angeles.

3229,A roundup of ingredients — from pore-clearing black lava salt to soothing palmarosa oil — that can help transform a simple soak into a restorative escape.,"Bathing is among our oldest self-care rituals: The ancient Greeks regularly soaked their aching muscles after workouts at the gymnasium, and the Romans constructed elaborate thermae — multiroom public bathhouses — throughout their empire from 27 B.C. Today, the tubs might be more technologically advanced but the practice remains deeply soothing. “Sitting in water is the ideal environment for calming the mind and body,” says the New York-based facialist Nachi Kanemaru Glick, who grew up taking a nightly bath at her childhood home in Miyazaki, Japan. “The water helps ingredients penetrate the skin, the heat releases tension and it’s a quiet time for meditation and self-reflection.” Or as Deborah Hanekamp, a New York-based wellness expert and author of the book “Ritual Baths” (out March 24) puts it, “We all feel one way before we get in the bath, and then a bit better when we get out.” The right mix of products and atmosphere can easily elevate the average soak, says the British facialist Alexandra Soveral, who has a background in chemistry.

3904,Adam Wallacavage’s fascinations with period architecture and the sea converge in his maximalist Philadelphia brownstone.,"Stepping inside Adam Wallacavage’s 3,500-square-foot Gothic Victorian South Philadelphia brownstone, purchased by the sculptor and lighting designer in 2000, is like being transported into a grand turn-of-the-20th-century Louis Sullivan building crossed with a pirate ship. The 12 overstuffed rooms, spread across three floors, are packed with Victorian and Art Nouveau-inspired details, such as Tiffany-style lamps and taxidermy, that feel in keeping with the buildings’ ornate crown moldings and pocket doors. But more eye-catching still are the fantastical nautical artifacts he collects, including a six-foot-long fiberglass alligator and a delicate paper replica of a coelacanth fish purchased from an Atlanta flea market. The foam-green and aquamarine painted walls are also covered in works by Wallacavage’s artist friends — in the parlor, inches from the Victorian wainscoting, is an original spray-painted tag by the Philadelphia graffiti artist Cornbread — and his own curbside finds. In the kitchen, a mint-condition sign from the iconic local business Bambi Cleaners, fished from the trash, looks down from atop an ivory-painted 1940s-era cabinet.","An Artist’s Gothic Townhouse, Filled With Octopus-Shaped Lamps",2020-03-25T13:00:10+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Wallacavage, Adam;Interior Design and Furnishings;Art;Lighting;Philadelphia (Pa)"

But this didn’t prove particularly daunting for the New York- and Los Angeles-based interior designer Alex P. White, 50, who was tasked with designing this compact space on Orchard Street last spring. White, who trained as an artist before working with the acclaimed interior designer Kelly Behun and then going out on his own three years ago, favors dark, moody lighting anyway; his Instagram page is filled with vintage photos of interiors that, unlike the bright rooms seen in home magazines today, were taken after sundown. After all, says White, “that’s when we spend the most time at home — at night.” For this project, White stuck to his druthers, making lighting a key component in what became an atmospheric oasis that recalls both the minimalism and the glamour of the ’70s.","A Glamorous, ’70s-Style Retreat in Downtown Manhattan",2020-03-26T18:18:54+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Interior Design and Furnishings;Real Estate and Housing (Residential);Furniture;Design;White, Alex P;Lower East Side (Manhattan, NY)"
