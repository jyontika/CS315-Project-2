His arms flail, his eyes roll back into his head, he picks up a drink.

The act of motion, by bicycle, car, boat or plane, shines a flashlight onto our lives, creating a shadow play of memories and new experiences.

281,"Some of the year’s best photography books come from artists like Carrie Mae Weems and Susan Meiselas, Rosamond Purcell and Lorna Simpson.","In the early 1970s, before she gained fame for her photojournalism during the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua, Susan Meiselas documented the “girlie shows” that were a feature of county fairs then. She went back year after year during the season, to a series of small towns primarily in Maine and Vermont. The shows were often raw, with customers permitted physical contact. No women were allowed into the tent, but Meiselas won the trust of the performers and was able to shoot backstage and eventually cover the entire event, sometimes in male guise. She interviewed the women at length, and incorporated transcriptions in the resulting book, CARNIVAL STRIPPERS (C/O Berlin/Steidl/D.A.P., 301 pp., $95), which was originally published in 1976 and is now in a lavish new two-volume edition. As Meiselas wrote in 1976, “Like the show, the book represents coexistent aspects of a phenomenon, one which horrifies, one which honors.” The pictures, which were shot in smoky low-light on black-and-white film in the original volume, cover both sides with candor and equanimity: the skin show of imperfect bodies and primordial gawkers out front and the world of female intimacy backstage. You can feel her affection for her subjects, but none of the other emotions on display are quite that simple.

330,"In 1975, Penny Wolin moved into a hotel on Hollywood Boulevard and started taking pictures of her fellow residents. “Guest Register” collects her work.","Between Hollywood, the geographical reality, and “Hollywood,” the dream capital of the American imagination, lies an uncertain distance. People come to Los Angeles for many reasons, but almost all have to do with escape and ambition, with the desire to close the gap between who they are and who they might become. Penny Wolin’s GUEST REGISTER (Crazy Woman Creek Press, 88 pp., $125) takes as its subject the residents of the St. Francis Hotel on Hollywood Boulevard, a once-elegant establishment that, by the time the author moved into it in the spring of 1975, had fallen into disrepair. Wolin’s photographs depict her neighbors with an uncanny, and unexpected, tenderness. In lieu of the starker revelations of, say, a Nan Goldin, we find warmth and invitation, a genuine sweetness in the presence of her subjects, who include a Vietnam veteran, a retired set designer, a former child actor, an ex-rodeo rider and just about every other sort of person in between. What makes “Guest Register” so remarkable is not just its gentle spirit, nor even its democratic reach, but rather the expansiveness that grows out of these things together. Captioned in a way that is at once playful and exacting, and coupled with a brief essay that collapses the space between what Wolin calls “existential Hollywood” and the actual place, these portraits show the opposite of what you might expect: a world in which dreams may be diminished but their originators, these noble occupants of the St. Francis Hotel, are radiant, beautiful, timelessly alive.","She Checked In, and Immediately Checked Out Her Neighbors",2022-12-02T19:55:40+0000,article,Books,Review,"Photography;Books and Literature;Hollywood (Calif);Guest Register (Book);Wolin, Penny;Hotels and Travel Lodgings"
331,"Fitzgerald’s paper dolls, collected in a book by her granddaughter, reveal her to have been a talented, whimsical and ambitious artist.","With audacity, boldness and style to spare, Zelda Fitzgerald was the original American flapper, providing inspiration for virtually every female character her husband, Scott, ever wrote, and matching him stride for stride in their heyday. She was legendary for being outrageous, plunging fully clothed into the fountain at the Plaza — but what she burned for was being taken seriously as an artist. With tireless intensity, she strained toward that goal, first as a ballerina and then as a writer, desperate to earn her own living. Her own identity. Her painting was more personal and spontaneous, however, a way to express an overflow of emotion and sensitivity. She began painting dolls in 1926, for her daughter, Scottie, and returned to them for the rest of her life. Collected at long last by Zelda’s granddaughter, Eleanor Lanahan, in THE PAPER DOLLS OF ZELDA FITZGERALD (Scribner, 116 pp., $25.99), the dolls retain an intimacy that’s more piercing somehow for being whimsical: playthings too gorgeous to touch. There are stowaways from classic fairy tales captured rapturously in gouache, with sly revisions (the Big Bad Wolff-Wolff has been granted a party dress) and notably prescient androgyny. Every flounce and shoe buckle of the courtiers, knights and musketeers reveals a studiousness close to reverence for the details of period costumery, just as the exaggerated musculature of the figures shows the painter’s deep knowledge of — and rapt fascination with — the human form. Given Zelda’s failure to make her mark as an artist and her decades-long struggle with mental illness, the genius of the dolls is close to heartbreaking. And yet this is a book she longed to see in print: one dream that has survived the collapse of her own fairy tale.","Zelda Fitzgerald, Costume Artist",2022-12-02T19:59:21+0000,article,Books,Review,"Books and Literature;Dolls;Fitzgerald, Zelda;Lanahan, Eleanor"

Of course, games can also divide us, often inciting a beguiling and fiery partisanship. The richness of Vandenbussche’s vision (with accompanying text by Rose Casella) is that it incorporates the exhilaration of both union and rivalry.

The first was “Archibald Motley: Jazz Age Modernist” at the Whitney in 2015-16, and the second was “Max Beckmann in New York” at the Met a year later. The Harlem Renaissance painter Motley’s interest in nightlife scenes generated complex, dynamic tableaus of African Americans at leisure, and work, in jazz clubs. When the German artist Beckmann lived in New York, the King Cole bar at the St. Regis and the Palm Court at the Plaza were among his haunts.

When I first saw the images, I was drawn to the bold, unapologetic displays of love — love that is often stereotyped or kept secret. This is the kind of book that I would have wanted as a young queer woman who had to find my own way, navigating not only what it means to be a Black Jamaican lesbian, but what it means to exist as beloved. To see joy sparkle in the eyes, around the corners of the mouth; to see bodies fused together in postures of love; to see the tenderness and the vulnerability between couples who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or trans. It is as wonderful to behold as it is to be held: the pleasure of seeing such love, believing in it. A love so complete that it transcends race, ethnicity, gender, and defies the heteronormative gaze. This book not only forces us to look at the realness of love, captured brilliantly by Pfluger’s lens, but removes the hinges from the door that separates the observed and the observer. Pfluger brings us closer to each couple, delicately depicting their mutual affection: how they love in defiance, out of necessity. The images are powerful, revolutionary, challenging us to transcend our own perceptions of what love looks like and the many ways of defining it.","Love Makes a Family — and for This Photographer, a Book",2022-12-02T20:17:36+0000,article,Books,Review,"Books and Literature;Homosexuality and Bisexuality;Transgender and Transsexuals;Photography;Love (Emotion);Holding Space: Life and Love Through a Queer Lens (Book);Pfluger, Ryan"

LISTEN (Rizzoli, 271 pp., $65), a collection of striking photos by Rhona Bitner, represents a visual celebration of room tone. For years, Bitner has traveled the country capturing the vibe of recording studios and concert halls — from the Apollo and the Bitter End in New York to the Hollywood Palladium and the Hollywood Bowl — when there are no performers onstage and no audience to cheer them on. “Here are the ghost ships of American music,” Iggy Pop writes in the foreword. You mean these are pictures of silence? Well, it’s more complicated than that — and more surprising. Here’s a living room in Washington State, decorated with taxidermy and a rust-hued carpet, where the band that would become Nirvana played publicly for the first time. Here’s a high school auditorium in Minnesota where a kid who would become Bob Dylan covered Little Richard at a talent show and was shut down by the principal. Isaac Hayes, the Staple Singers and Big Star summoned angels in an unexpectedly grand sanctuary of Ardent Studios in Memphis, while Iggy & the Stooges raised hell at the Grande Ballroom in Detroit, a space that’s now, as Iggy puts it, “just a pile of frightening rubble in a dark catacomb.” Bitner’s photographs give us a phantom history of American sound from Duke Ellington to the White Stripes, but what you hear depends on the room tone within your own mind.","In Empty Arenas and Studios, No Sound but Lots of Vision",2022-12-02T20:22:05+0000,article,Books,Review,"Books and Literature;Photography;Music;Theaters (Buildings);Listen (Book);Bitner, Rhona"

Dawes’s speaker feels invisible and asynchronous: “they cannot see/the despair in my eyes.” By the end, the speaker has loosened decorum and commands someone, anyone, to “Look/at my eyes. Pay attention,” as if ordering the speaker himself to remember he is alive, visible and real in an infinite and unfamiliar land.

That does it for the morning — the last thing I want is to add more steps to get ready at the start of the day; hence Keurig coffee in the morning, usually accompanied by yogurt, granola, blueberries, and honey. After rehearsal, I’ll often have a Clif Builders Bar (chocolate mint is my favorite). Fragrance-wise, I love Boy Smells’ Flor de la Virgen; I apply it before rehearsals, with touch-ups during and after. For performances, a lot of male dancers use company-provided cosmetics, but I’m a bit more particular because of my skin’s sensitivities. I love Wet N Wild foundation and LA Girl Pro concealer. As a dancer of color, I love that the finish of L’Oréal’s powder is more of a warm banana shade than a white. Post-performance is crucial: I love Jordan Samuel Skin’s After Show Treatment Cleanser; developed by a dancer, it doesn’t foam as much as other cleansers and is oil-based to help break down makeup without too much skin-damaging abrasion. For particularly involved looks, I also use Aveeno’s makeup wipes. Masks help as well. I like Youth to the People’s Hydrate + Glow Dream Mask as well as its Superclay Purify + Clear Power Mask, which is great when makeup is really caked into my pores. Recently, I did a program with a lot of body paint and Athena Club’s body wash was great to get it off. It’s more creamy than soapy, with plenty of vitamins to nourish my skin as it gets rid of paint and sweat.","Phoebe Bridgers’s Jewelry Designs Have Hand-Written Lyrics and, Unsurprisingly, Skulls",2022-12-14T20:00:09+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Cosmetics and Toiletries;Bridgers, Phoebe (1994- );Watters, Harper;Paris (France);Retinol"

Much of the food will be cooked in a tandoor clay oven. Aslam’s butter chicken, based on a recipe from a street food vendor in old Delhi, and a minced meat skewer, called dori kebab said to have been created centuries ago, are two dishes that Mr. Mehta and Mr. Shinde are bringing to the restaurant.

The rice dishes include a Malabar bone marrow pulao. There are 55 seats in the main dining room, another 18 at the bar and room for 20 in a sidewalk enclosure.
