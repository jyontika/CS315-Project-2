But this one by Gabrielle Calvocoressi charms because of its delicate intimacy.,"I find love poems hard to write (and to read) because they can so easily teeter on the edge of sentimentality. I much prefer the conflagration of a good breakup poem. But this poem by Gabrielle Calvocoressi charms me because of its delicate intimacy. The second person “you” in the first line and throughout the poem invites the reader into a private relationship.

About halfway down an intermediate-grade slope on his first run that morning, the man started to feel bad, as if he were coming down with something. He rested for a few minutes and when that didn’t help, headed back to the lodge. The trip down was miserable. He felt a strange exhaustion and had to stop every few minutes, as if he were running up the mountain rather than skiing down. It was so bad that, at one point, he worried he would have to be taken in by the ski patrol. But he made it.

Now,  this restaurant in the Hotel Chelsea on West 23rd Street, one of the city’s oldies — it first opened in 1930 — will open its doors again this week.

Sunday Hospitality, the owners of Sunday in Brooklyn, is running it with Charles Seich, a new partner here, and the company’s culinary director and partner, Jaime Young, is in charge of the food. At his side is the chef de cuisine Byron Hogan, who cooked in Spain for the past 12 years, mostly in Madrid, and moved to the United States to work here. “We want to make it authentic, looking more to the north of Spain with the Basque Country and Galicia,” Mr. Young said. Without straying far from the traditional, the chefs have come up with a dish that combines boquerones and oil-cured anchovies, a combination of preserved tuna with leeks and tomato, and squid with morcilla sausage. The paella for which the restaurant has long been known is now made mostly with seafood and also rabbit. The portions are not as massive as in the old days, but that era is evoked by pitchers with red and white sangrias. Spain dominates the wine list, and there are sherries, gins, vermouths and ciders. Burgundy leather, wrought iron, dark wood and a recently uncovered tile floor define the space, with a bar, a few tables and intimate booths. Later this year, Sunday Hospitality will open a French American bistro in the hotel.

An ensemble of seven Black and white men and women in sequined blazers, platinum wigs and vinyl vests, they played a rapid-fire medley of their most affirming hits: “Everyday People,” “Dance to the Music,” “Sing a Simple Song,” “I Want to Take You Higher.” They had just released their third studio album, “Life” (1968), and everyone looks excited, although Sly Stone alone appears confident that the whole thing will come off. We see why when he leaves the organ and heads out into the studio audience with his sister Rose: After her solo, he performs a dance routine drawn from Africa, patting juba. “We look like we just landed in a spaceship from Venus,” the group’s original drummer, Greg Errico, tells me of the clip. Men in the audience are wearing suits that “weren’t even cool suits — they look like accountants.” Before heading back to the stage, Stone finds what may have been the one Black man in the crowd and slaps him five.

The most recent hotel addition, Hoshino Resorts’ KAI Poroto, which opened last month, is located on Hokkaido’s southwestern coast near the new Upopoy National Ainu Museum and Park. Guests of the ryokan hotel — which consists of 42 rooms that each look out onto Lake Poroto (poroto ko means “big lake” in the Ainu language) — can spend the day immersing themselves in Hokkaido’s Indigenous history through the museum’s various exhibitions, before returning to the resort for a dip at either of the two bathhouses — one of which features a ketunni (or “tripod-frame”) design — with their alkaline waters rich in humic and fulvic acids. For travelers hoping for a sportier trip, head northwest a couple of hours to Niseko and book a stay at Raku Suisan, an intimate ryokan at the foot of four of the town’s famed ski resorts.

2267,The franchise has always portrayed the police as flawed but ultimately good. The latest spinoff does away with that ambivalence.,"If you were going to watch a police procedural — which, for the record, I don’t particularly recommend — you could do worse than NBC’s “Law & Order” franchise. Across 32 years and more than 1,200 episodes, the original series and its six American spinoffs have offered a gentle critique of law enforcement, presenting a parade of flawed individuals navigating a byzantine justice system. Detectives are stymied by bureaucrats and squabble with lunkhead patrol officers, who reliably contaminate crime scenes. Idealistic prosecutors grow disillusioned and leave for nonprofit work. And yet the franchise still hinges on a lesser-of-two-evils logic: The institutions may be imperfect, and the cops imperfect, but their vocation is, by definition, good. There are always more victims to avenge, and none better equipped to do it than the New York Police Department.",‘Law & Order’ Is Having an Identity Crisis,2022-02-16T10:00:08+0000,article,Magazine,News,"Television;Meloni, Christopher;Hargitay, Mariska;Law & Order (TV Program);Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (TV Program);Law & Order: Organized Crime (TV Program)"

2270,How defiant Covid-era customers turned a dream job — flight attendant — into a total nightmare.,"It was the German shepherd in Row 4 that finally pushed Veronica, a flight attendant, over the edge. He was Veronica’s third ‘unruly passenger,’ as the Federal Aviation Administration calls them, in one month. A week or two before the dog, a middle-aged man reacted belligerently when, just before he boarded the plane, Veronica asked him to pull up his mask. ‘Who do you think you are, you liberals?!’ he screamed at her. ‘These masks don’t work.’ Then he threatened to punch her in the face. About a week before, it was a group of young female athletes. The girls kept removing their masks when they talked to one another, and Veronica, who was working the back of the plane near the girls, repeatedly reminded them: “Please put your mask on.” (She and most other attendants asked me not to use their full names, either because an airline’s media policy does not allow them to speak without permission or for fear that doing so might hinder their employment.) “Please put your mask on,” a girl mocked Veronica each time she said it. When the girl got up to go to the bathroom, without a mask, Veronica asked again. The girl, who was about 5-foot-10 and towered over Veronica’s 5-foot-2 frame, said: “I’m so sick and tired of you, bitch. You don’t have authority over me.” They were almost body to body in the cramped area near the lavatory, and Veronica feared the girl was about to hit her, before one of the coaches intervened.",See (the Worst People in) the World!,2022-02-16T10:00:10+0000,article,Magazine,News,Flight Attendants;AIRLINES AND AIRPLANES;Assaults;Workplace Hazards and Violations;Labor and Jobs;Assn of Flight Attendants;Quarantine (Life and Culture);Masks;Coronavirus (2019-nCoV);audio-neutral-immersive

2435,This week’s latest top sellers include unexpected treats and old favorites.,"ORIGINAL KIN In the vibrant potluck that is the best-seller list, occasionally we find a book that stands out among the usual bowls of chili, trays of baked ziti and platters of Rice Krispie treats. This week the dish that isn’t quite like the others — thriller, mystery, memoir or biography, and so forth — is Jennifer Raff’s “Origin,” which our reviewer described as a “masterly retelling of the story of how, and when, people reached the Americas.” Raff, an anthropological geneticist at the University of Kansas, writes in her introduction, “Looking at the genetic evidence, we will examine the ways in which DNA has challenged and changed our understanding of Native American history, with a special focus on the events that are only indirectly understandable with the archaeological record.” Her approach will be accessible to the pickiest readers, layering personal anecdotes with a visit to a gene-sequencing lab, heavy on compassion and light on jargon. A Goodreads reviewer put it like this about Raff: “As a young mother she can’t help but impart some poignancy in her accounts of those burial sites where toddlers are interred. In doing so she highlights — as she does throughout the book — the humanity of the person whose remains are the subject of research.” “Origin” is Raff’s first book, and it lands on the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 8.",The Best-Seller List Is a Smorgasbord,2022-02-17T10:00:03+0000,article,Books,List,"Books and Literature;Archaeology and Anthropology;Genetics and Heredity;Hari, Johann;Raff, Jennifer;Origin (Book);Stolen Focus: Why You Can't Pay Attention -- and How to Think Deeply Again (Book)"

The Westminster Gazette says such a service would be unique in the annals of the City Cathedral. “Meanwhile,” writes a representative of that paper who has been making inquiries, “it would be injudicious to assume the accuracy of the foregoing statement, seeing that nothing has, as yet, been decided on the subject whatever, and so far as the Cathedral authorities are concerned, at all events, it is very doubtful whether they would lend their approval to any such scheme as that foreshadowed, the objections to which, it is urged, are many and serious. We understand that a meeting of the committee which has the matter in hand, over which Dean Gregory presides, and at which the Prince of Wales will be present, will be held this afternoon for further consideration of the matter.”",1897: Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee Proposals,2022-02-21T10:00:02+0000,article,World,News,

3025,"An excerpt from “Watergate: A New History,” by Garrett M. Graff","As the thirty-seventh occupant of his office, Richard Nixon had settled into the White House under a new reality: Washington, D.C., had changed dramatically since World War II, as what had once been a relatively sleepy southern town conducting part-time business had morphed into the all-consuming locus of federal power, directing the world’s largest economy and driving foreign affairs the world over. With that shift—and the massive and ever-swelling bureaucracy that came with it—the presidency had changed too; what for much of America’s first two centuries had been the office tasked with executing policy and spending money decided and set by Congress had seen that power dynamic reverse and instead now piloted the national agenda itself. It was a job now far too big for one man, even as the White House absorbed, stole, and agglomerated still more power and personnel. To Nixon, figuring out how to staff the oversized presidency—whom to trust, how to inspire them and manage them—consumed far too much energy. “It would be god damn easy to run this office if you didn’t have to deal with people,” he lamented.","‘Watergate: A New History,’ by Garrett M.

3136,"An all-day offshoot of Patisserie Chanson, a neighborhood bistro for Park Slope, and more restaurant news.","For this new restaurant, the Brazilian architect Isay Weinfeld has not radically disrupted his design for the Four Seasons 2.0, which briefly occupied the space until 2019. He repeated the tawny tones of the wood-paneled main dining room, but now the floor is carpeted, the lighting is softer and wood dividers separate some tables. It is the first New York restaurant for the Fasano Group, a restaurant and hotel powerhouse based in São Paulo, Brazil. (Mr. Weinfeld has designed a number of the group’s many properties.) Gero Fasano, who runs the company in partnership with the developers JHSF, said the new restaurant had to be warmer, more appealing and better for sound. The food is expense-account Northern Italian, mostly traditional and often elaborate, including bollito misto dispensed from a silver cart. The former bar in the front room is now a more informal osteria with linen place mats instead of tablecloths, a huge bar along the windows and a somewhat simpler menu written on smoky mirrors (think spaghetti with tomato sauce and no risotti). The wine selection is global. There is no art on the walls in the dining areas. In late March, outdoor seating will be added, and, upstairs in a few months, there will be a spacious cabaret. Mr. Fasano’s company was founded in 1902 when his Milanese great-grandfather emigrated to Brazil. The family was in and out of the restaurant business over the decades until Mr. Fasano, against the advice of his father who made his fortune in distilleries, plunged in and has applied his exacting standards ever since. The executive chef, Nicola Fedeli, a Florentine who has worked with the company for several years, adheres to Mr. Fasano’s strict demands as to preparation and presentation. There’s no New York-style salad on top of the oversize, impossibly thin $70 veal Milanese; it’s served on the side lest the veal get soggy.

Containers are supplied to the restaurants at no charge; customers, who pay a 99-cent fee added to their bills, can return them to any restaurant in the company’s network. The polypropylene plastic containers, which can be microwaved and withstand a commercial dishwasher, are cleaned and reused by the restaurants. Late last year, DoorDash and Caviar signed on for what Mr. Farbiarz said was a pilot program, and began offering the containers as an option when an order is placed at participating restaurants on their platforms.

3877,The U.S. and the European Union have imposed a range of financial penalties on Russia. Companies are again setting dates for return to the office. And the February jobs numbers come out.,"Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine whipsawed global markets amid uncertainty over the conflict’s potential impact on inflation, the operations of multinational corporations, energy prices and the flow of energy to Europe. In recent years, Europe has received nearly 40 percent of its gas and more than a quarter of its oil from Russia. In addition, Ukraine and Russia together produce nearly a quarter of the world’s wheat, and Russia is a key supplier of other major commodities. The fallout from the conflict is likely to continue to push up inflation. That creates an economic pickle for the Federal Reserve and its plans to begin raising interest rates in March. Pulling back support for the economy may help reduce inflation, but it also could weigh on economic growth if consumers reduce their spending. Several Fed officials have signaled that they are unlikely to change course.","The Week in Business: With Ukraine Invasion, Volatile Markets",2022-02-27T12:00:07+0000,article,Business Day,News,Stocks and Bonds;United States Economy;Russian Invasion of Ukraine (2022);International Trade and World Market;Inflation (Economics)

There are details for about 50 labels, and the book serves as a technical primer on Irish whiskey cocktails and how to build them. Following recipes for six classics, there are scores of Dead Rabbit creations, most of which call for esoteric ingredients like tonka bean syrup, za’atar tincture and toasted fennel salt (recipes are provided).
