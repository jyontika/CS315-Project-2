Yes, there is the ease of one-click ordering your next read along with your paper towels; yes, if you present purchasing buttons in alphabetical order, Amazon will land at the top of the list. But if you are an author, like Towles, who claims to appreciate local bookshops for “hand selling” your work, why not direct your readers straight to Indiebound, which helps keep the light on in those stores?

The founder, Kurt Oriol, who is from Spain, had previously helped create Iberian Pastures, a company that raises Spanish heirloom breed pigs in Georgia. Campo Grande sells a box of assorted cuts of pork: a hefty four-rib roast, a thick presa from the loin for roasting or grilling, and two prized shoulder sections, pluma and secreto. Each one provides at least four servings of succulent, tender meat, best cooked just shy of medium. The company is also importing aged beef and some seafood.",Fresh Ibérico Pork Delivered to Your Door,2022-01-10T20:30:15+0000,article,Food,News,Spain;Pork
1064,"Prufrock, a washed-rind cheese from Grey Barn on Martha’s Vineyard, took honors at the recent World Cheese Awards.","A satiny washed-rind beauty named Prufrock was the first cheese made at the Grey Barn, a farm and dairy on Martha’s Vineyard, which was established in 2009 and began selling the cheese in 2012. The tidy eight-ounce square, encased in an edible orange-hued rind, has collected awards over the years, and in the 2021 World Cheese Awards, Prufrock was one of six cheeses from five countries to win gold in the general washed-rind category. It also won recognition at the first New York International Cheese competition, held last summer. The cheese, made from organic milk, has alluring washed rind funkiness, with a scent of dried wildflowers and a yeasty, briny tang on the palate. Eric and Molly Glasgow, the farm’s owners, decided to go poetic with the name instead of giving it a local tie-in. They’ve continued in that vein with most of their other cheeses, including Banneker, their newest, a Cheddar they started making during the pandemic and only sell locally. It’s named for Benjamin Banneker, an 18th century African American mathematician and astronomer and the subject of a poem by Rita Dove.",The Big Cheeses From the Vineyard,2022-01-10T20:30:29+0000,article,Food,News,Cheese;Martha's Vineyard (Mass)
1065,Fort Hamilton Brooklyn Barrel-Aged Maple Syrup gets its flavor from a stint in a recycled liquor barrel in Industry City.,"Fort Hamilton Distillery, a five-year-old enterprise in Industry City, Brooklyn, named for the 19th century military installation guarding the east side of the Narrows in New York Harbor (Fort Wadsworth on Staten Island faces it to the west), specializes in rye whiskies, and also makes bourbon. To this portfolio it has just added a bourbon barrel-aged maple syrup. The organic syrup, from the Catskills, is given 100 days in the charred white oak barrels used to age its whiskies. The deep amber syrup is thick and scented of earth and smoke, elements that carry into its rich flavor. Alex Clark — who founded the distillery with his wife, Amy Grindeland — is making it as a way to further the life of the bourbon barrels, since according to federal standards, the whiskey must be aged in new barrels. Mr. Clark uses the syrup in an old-fashioned.

And he has also put his stamp on some shapes like a wide, two-handled rondeau and a saucier, new to Hestan’s inventory. The pans are stainless steel with an aluminum core, have handles designed to stay cool, are made with flush rivets on the inside for better cleaning and have two universal lids.

The lineup includes Mr. Smalls’s own Shoebox Bakery, Chicken Coop and Sweet Ophelia’s, an Afro-Asian wok bar.

Le Moné, a new Meyer lemon drink made in Hammondsport, N.Y., has enough bright, citric flavor to cancel winter. It is called an aperitif wine because its base alcohol is wine, from the Finger Lakes region in western New York. Eric Bachli, a former brewmaster at Sixpoint Brewery in Brooklyn, collaborated with Max Nevins, also of Sixpoint Brewery, and Marissa Reiser, a sommelier, to create the aperitif. California brandy adds a kick to the 32 proof drink. Restrained sweetening is provided by organic blue agave syrup from Mexico, and Meyer lemons, mostly from a distillate using the peels, create the lightly bitter citric profile. It’s mellow yet refreshing on the rocks or in a spritz; it finds its calling added to dry gin, martini-style with a twist.

The textile, created from a blend of strong but elastic fibers, is both quick-drying and chlorine-resistant, making it uniquely versatile. “Everything is designed to be used as swimwear, sportswear, underwear or shapewear,” Laub says. “The fabric allows for powerful fits that provide support without a traditional under-wiring structure.” Sustainability is also at the forefront of her vision: Each collection is made in Italy using 3-D knitting techniques that create less waste.

2873,Joe McShea and Edgar Mosa first caught the attention of Jonathan Anderson with their flag installations on Fire Island. Then they flew to Paris to make something new.,"In the summer of 2020, when Americans were cautiously emerging from the first Covid-19 lockdown, the multimedia artists Joe McShea and Edgar Mosa quit New York City for Fire Island, a long strip of land just south of Long Island, and began making flags. McShea started out in photography while Mosa trained as a goldsmith, but the two, now partners in work and in life, have long been preoccupied with the interaction between fabric and the elements. In 2018, inspired by the Baroque frescoes at the 13th-century Palazzo Monti, in Brescia, Italy, where they were artists-in-residence, they developed a series of ephemeral sculptures by wrapping stone staircases in ribbons and photographing fabric in water. As an afterthought, they also created a flag made of ribbons fixed to a cardboard tube with masking tape. Though it was simple, they felt it had power and, sure enough, things took off two summers later, when the duo began sewing colorful hand-dyed silks, deadstock ribbons and tulle to lengths of ribbon that, doubled over, acted as halyards — or, as they refer to them, hoist ribbons — and tying those with simple bows to scavenged bamboo poles, which they planted on the beaches of Fire Island Pines.",The Artists Behind the Ribbon-Filled Set of Loewe’s Men’s Show,2022-01-24T21:46:29+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Loewe SA;Anderson, Jonathan William (1984- );Art;Flags, Emblems and Insignia;Fashion and Apparel;Fire Island (NY);McShea, Joe (Artist);Mosa, Edgar (Artist)"

A year earlier, Fanone was a 40-year-old Metropolitan Police Department (M.P.D.) officer trying to hold off an angry mob outside the United States Capitol. The rioters pulled him from a tunnel and down a set of steps, pummeled him with their fists and their feet and even the staff of an American flag and tased him numerous times; in the melee, he suffered both a heart attack and a traumatic brain injury. Now Fanone was outside the Capitol again, on the set of CNN’s “New Day” morning show, sitting next to its hosts, John Berman and Brianna Keilar. He wore faded jeans and a red-and-black plaid parka, in stark contrast to Berman’s and Keilar’s news-anchor attire. With his heavy beard and a turtleneck of tattoos peeking out from underneath his collar, he looked like some sort of punk lumberjack. He sounded like one too. When Keilar asked him to share some of the conversations he was having with police officers as the anniversary approached, Fanone acidly noted that the U.S. Capitol Police “have to walk the same halls as some of these insurrectionist members of Congress,” before adding, “I couldn’t imagine sharing a work space with those jackasses.”","To Hell and Back, Then to CNN",2022-01-26T10:00:12+0000,article,Magazine,News,"Fanone, Michael;CNN;Cable Television;News and News Media;Storming of the US Capitol (Jan, 2021);United States Politics and Government;Metropolitan Police Department (DC);Attacks on Police"

3784,"The spirit is named after Jokiche Takamine, a 19th century chemist who had a distillery in Chicago.","Koji, a type of mold, has been used in Japan for centuries in the fermentation needed to produce soy sauce, miso and sake. It can also be used to ferment grain for whiskey, which is usually made with malted barley. Takamine, an exceptionally smooth koji-fermented whiskey from Shinozaki Brewery & Distillery in Japan, is now available in the United States. It has a slight mushroom aroma and deserves to be sipped neat. You could call its arrival a return: In the 1890s, Jōkichi Takamine, a Japanese chemist who married an American woman, settled in Chicago and started producing koji-fermented whiskey. After the distillery was destroyed by a fire, he turned to medical research in New York and went on to isolate chemical adrenaline. His success allowed him to donate cherry trees to Washington, D.C., and to establish the Nippon Club in New York. He played a diplomatic role after World War I and is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx. The 8-year-old whiskey is the first product to bear his name.","Takamine, a Koji-Fermented Whiskey, Arrives Stateside",2022-01-31T21:17:28+0000,article,Food,News,Whiskey
3785,‘The Ucross Cookbook’ provides recipes and testimonials from an artist residency program founded in 1983.,"Ucross, located on a ranch in northeast Wyoming, houses an artist residency program founded in 1983 and has provided inspiration to such figures as the poet and performer Karma Mayet Johnson, the journalist and novelist Suki Kim and the baritone Nathan Gunn, among many others. Their tenures at the ranch were punctuated by meals from the kitchen of Cindy Brooks, who, with Cree LeFavour, a former resident, has now written “The Ucross Cookbook.” (Sales support the nonprofit.) Worth preparing are caramelized carrots with ras-el-hanout; hard winter spinach soup; soba noodles with coconut, chiles and kale; and Powder River meatballs. “Poet’s Lunch” peanut butter cookies were a big hit, and I was delighted to see that someone beside me simmers jasmine rice in jasmine tea. The recipes do not provide yields, though the authors say one should assume around six servings for many. Experienced cooks would not be daunted.

With “Breaking Bread,” the documentary filmmaker Beth Elise Hawk captured the festival in 2017 and 2018 with appropriately mouthwatering scenes. The emphasis of the film shows how chefs from different backgrounds, religions and cultures can cooperate. “When I founded the A-Sham festival I did not want to say Israel, I didn’t want to say Palestine,” Dr. Ismaeel said in the trailer for the documentary. “I don’t believe there is any room for politics in the kitchen.”",‘Breaking Bread’ Showcases the A-Sham Food Festival in Israel,2022-01-31T21:20:49+0000,article,Food,News,Cooking and Cookbooks;Documentary Films and Programs;Chefs

3795,"In his latest works, the artist Troy Lamarr Chew II has embedded references to the Bart Simpson, the Shopping Cart and many other familiar moves.","Last year, Troy Lamarr Chew II spent countless hours in the studio. If he weren’t an artist, though, he might be a linguist, a semiotics professor or a rapper. Or at least that’s the sense you get after spending time with his “Slanguage” paintings, which are imbued with messages that aren’t immediately apparent, and that often require knowledge of wordplay to decode. The series began, in 2019, as a shout-out to regional slang from Oakland, Calif., and the rest of the Bay Area. Take “Yay Area” (2020), a realist composition that brings together recognizable and mundane food items: a Coca-Cola bottle turned on its side, a chocolate layer cake atop a pedestal and a glass bowl filled with scoops of vanilla ice cream. At first glance, the still life, which recalls the work of the American painter Wayne Thiebaud, impresses with its skill and precision and evokes nostalgia for sugary childhood treats. Depending on your familiarity with certain hip-hop lyrics, though, it may later occur to you that the artist has depicted foods whose names, like the “Yay” of the title, are slang for cocaine (coke, cola, cake), and one that references the Oakland artist Dru Down’s 1993 song “Ice Cream Man,” its title an allusion to a drug dealer (though he’s hardly the only rapper to have used the term). Another work of Chew’s, “Ball Street Journal” (2020), includes images of cheese, bread and paper — all terms for money.",Multilayered Paintings That Pay Tribute to Hip-Hop Dances,2022-01-31T21:53:31+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Chew, Troy Lamarr II;Art;Rap and Hip-Hop;Dancing;Slang;Altman Siegel (San Francisco, Calif, Gallery);Content Type: Personal Profile"
