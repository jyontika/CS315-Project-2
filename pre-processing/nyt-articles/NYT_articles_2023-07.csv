472,Lyn Hejinian’s sonnet proposes that liberation might be found in scattering and disorientation.,"Lyn Hejinian’s poem has the sonnet’s traditional 14 lines and even features the sonnet’s coupletlike resolution, but the length of its lines exceeds tradition, nearly reaching to the very edges of line itself. It borrows prose’s linear momentum but refuses the carelessness of prose’s wraparound ends. The power of these lines is, in part, generated by their quick liftoffs — each begins with a word of a single syllable. This is paired with cunning line breaks that enjamb, suggest, double the words that surround them and intensify the effect of the poem by giving it both vertical and horizontal motion. Throughout, there is thick sound stacked on thick sound, the diction mixed and surprising, the everyday and the erudite sparking like flint and steel. In my reading of the poem, it is as if the line is seeking to enact the poem’s proposition: that in the motion of scattering, in an orientation of disorientation, a possibility of liberation might be found.

Two narcotics cops — Jimmy (Popeye) Doyle, played by Gene Hackman, and Buddy (Cloudy) Russo, played by Roy Scheider — are at the precinct, following an undercover operation during which a drug dealer ended up slashing Russo with a knife. The injury has left Russo struggling to put on his coat. “Need a little help there?” Doyle chuckles, then adds an ethnic jab: “You dumb guinea.” Russo: “How the hell did I know he had a knife?” Here Doyle points a slur at the Black dealer: “Never trust a nigger.” Russo: “He could have been white.” Doyle: “Never trust anyone.” Then he invites Russo out for a drink, and they trade masturbation jokes as they head through the door.",What’s Lost When Censors Tamper With Classic Films,2023-07-06T09:00:32+0000,article,Magazine,News,"The French Connection (Movie);Censorship;Indecency, Obscenity and Profanity;Hackman, Gene;Black People;Blacks;Discrimination;Movies;Dahl, Roald;Twain, Mark"

516,"Plus: home décor from Ulla Johnson, a restaurant in a vintage airstream and more recommendations from T Magazine.","This spring, the chef Molly Levine began serving seasonal cuisine from a refurbished 1971 Airstream trailer parked on a former dairy farm in the Hudson Valley. Westerly Canteen’s trailer holds a compact kitchen with cream-painted walls and blond wood counters. “I had this wild idea, like, ‘What if we took the food truck concept and put it in a space that is still mobile but feels beautiful and welcoming?’” Levine said as she stirred a pot of golden-hued stock, fragrant with spring onion and green garlic. Levine, who previously worked at the Berkeley, Calif., restaurant Chez Panisse, founded Westerly with her partner, Alex Kaindl, a farmer who tends half an acre in Sharon, Conn. Nearly all of their ingredients are sourced from farms nearby. (Starting this month, Kaindl’s crops will also be incorporated.) Developing the weekly menu is a puzzle that requires maximizing limited space and resources. “A lot of our decisions are very creative and passion driven but also very practical,” Kaindl said as Levine ladled the stock over a plate of nettle-stuffed ravioli. “We slice up the spring onions that go into the dish, and the tops are made into the broth,” Levine said. “We’re using every piece of the onion.” The founders hope to engage the surrounding community while also drawing diners from afar. They’ve partnered with Tenmile Distillery, which offers cocktails made with local ingredients to go alongside Westerly’s menu (their take on a Negroni includes Faccia Brutto bitters from Brooklyn, Method sweet vermouth from Romulus and gin made on-site at Tenmile). “We really want people to sit here and stay a while,” Levine said. westerlycanteen.com.",A Hawaii Shop Turning Oahu’s Invasive Trees Into Surfboards,2023-07-06T13:00:12+0000,article,T Magazine,News,Wood and Wood Products;Surfing;Hawaii

677,This month’s picks include a hiking trip gone wrong and a luxury vacation that takes a depraved turn.,"Dan Berk and Robert Olsen’s film starts with a mysterious red flare streaking down from the sky, so right away we suspect who (or what) will trigger the plot. And it might not be friendly, because the odds of a backpacking trip going right in a sci-fi movie are fairly low. Indeed, things quickly go awry after Harry (Jake Lacy, from Season 1 of “The White Lotus”) and his girlfriend, Ruth (Maika Monroe, “It Follows”), take off on an isolated Oregon trail. She is wracked by anxiety so crippling that she has been taking medication and seeing a therapist, but gamely tries to not spoil a trip Jake has carefully planned. And then, of course, it all goes to pot, with a couple of nifty red herrings and plot twists spicing up the script. “Significant Other” (the title cleverly plays off a couple of different meanings) is a tight, effective hybrid of science fiction and horror, with the scares generated less by shock tactics than by a growing dread. That anguish is generated in the viewer in part by good filmmaking — the movie is briskly paced, well acted and moodily atmospheric (only the C.G.I. looks a little cheap). And partly it derives from “Significant Other” dealing with common preoccupations: Do we ever fully know who we lie next to?",Five Science Fiction Movies to Stream Now,2023-07-07T15:00:13+0000,article,Movies,News,"Movies;Significant Other (Movie);Infinity Pool (Movie);Costa Brava, Lebanon (Movie);Unidentified Objects (Movie);Simulant (Movie)"

Despite what may be recalled through the penumbra of memory, this sudden silence was not directly preceded by either of Cruise’s infamous appearances on television: not by his NBC’s “Today” show interview (in which he labeled host Matt Lauer both “glib” and “Matt — MattMattMattMatt”), nor even by his appearance on “The Oprah Winfrey Show” (in which he reverse-catapulted himself onto Winfrey’s fawn-colored couch multiple times in a demonstration of his enthusiasm for Holmes). Those incidents occurred seven years earlier, in 2005; Cruise emerged from the hex of public bewilderment unscathed. In fact, Cruise gave no indication that the interview, pegged to the musical-comedy bomb “Rock of Ages,” was intended to serve as a farewell address to journalists. At the time he sat for it, another life milestone was hurtling toward him: The month after the article was published, Holmes filed for divorce.",My Impossible Mission to Find Tom Cruise,2023-07-17T09:00:10+0000,article,Magazine,News,"Cruise, Tom;Actors and Actresses;Movies;Content Type: Personal Profile;internal-sub-only;England;Pitt, Brad;Mission Impossible (Movie);Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One (Movie)"

2230,Brandon Shimoda wrote this short poem after encountering a lost migrant in the Arizona desert.,"“The Desert,” from Brandon Shimoda’s new collection, “Hydra Medusa,” is emblematic of the complex lyric-historical landscape of borders, dreams, shrines and underworlds found throughout his work. I asked Shimoda about the context and composition of this poem, and his answer was a skillful, evocative illumination of the relationship between life and poetry: “I wrote this poem the night after going out on a water drop with a humanitarian-aid group. We drove for many hours through the desert, putting water out for migrants, people trying to stay alive. We met a man who, in the hallucinatory heat of Arizona, asked how far it was to Kentucky. Some important part of an individual exists in the places they are trying to reach, and it is excruciating. It is like we are following the signs and symbols of our future selves through the wilderness. I write poetry when I am feeling haunted by something — an image, encounter — although not as a means of exorcism. I think about what I have seen, heard, experienced, and I go under. I write poetry at night, partly because I believe there is a more humane, trustworthy logic to be found there, although like dreams, and like the landscapes in which they graze, the poems are themselves the interpretation.” Selected by Anne Boyer",Poem: The Desert,2023-07-20T09:00:03+0000,article,Magazine,News,Poetry and Poets;Arizona;Mexico

2671,"What T Magazine’s editors and contributors are bringing to thank their hosts this summer, including surrealistic serving spoons and bubbles to entertain children.","When the French interior designer Camille Vergnes throws a dinner party in Paris, she opts for unfussy white table linens and white plates. This allows her Art Deco-style set of serving spoons, salad servers and carving knives, all with almond green shagreen handles, to take center stage. “I use [the serving set] as the key piece of the table along with the flowers or candleholders,” she says. Vergnes’s approach reflects a shift in focus when it comes to tableware, away from handblown glassware and patterned napkins to sculptural utensils. In Copenhagen, stirred by her homeland’s history of silversmithing, the Danish jeweler Olga Bonne has added delicate hand-wrought silver spoons, forks and knives with handles in the shape of fish, kestrels or hares to her roster of whimsical creations. She takes inspiration from eras past, “when arts and crafts did not have to be functional but most of all ornamental and extravagant,” she says. Some designers are marrying the functional and fanciful: In Brighton, the British designer Alessandra Williams recently launched her namesake homeware label with sets of hand-carved salad servers in green leopard stone and blackened jacaranda wood made by Fair Trade co-operatives in Zimbabwe and Nairobi. Frank Traynor, the United States-based artist behind the Perfect Nothing Catalog, adorns everything from cheese graters to cake knives with copper and tin combined with semiprecious stones and shells, lending quotidian objects new charm. Then there’s the British chef and farmer Ben Bodman, who makes carbon Damascus steel knives with swirling patterns on the blades and myrtlewood and rosewood handles in Melksham, a small town in Wiltshire, England, under the label Bodman Blades. Presented to a hostess in lieu of a bottle of wine, these are practical gifts that will pull double duty as décor.","Host Gift Guide: Fun Ferments, Cozy Quilts and More",2023-07-24T09:00:13+0000,article,T Magazine,News,Quilts;Luxury Goods and Services;Utensils and Cutlery;Tableware;Handicrafts;Design;Textiles;Cooking and Cookbooks;Summer (Season);Gifts;Parties (Social)

More than three years into the pandemic and untold millions of people dead, that question about the Covid-19 coronavirus remains controversial and fraught, with facts sparkling amid a tangle of analyses and hypotheticals like Christmas lights strung on a dark, thorny tree.

Another school argues that the virus was laboratory-engineered to infect humans and cause them harm — a bioweapon — and was possibly devised in a “shadow project” sponsored by the People’s Liberation Army of China. A third school, more moderate than the second but also implicating laboratory work, suggests that the virus got into its first human victim by way of an accident at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (W.I.V.), a research complex on the eastern side of the city, maybe after well-meaning but reckless genetic manipulation that made it more dangerous to people.

Whole casts of voice actors might be hired to take on individual voices in nonfiction collections, like “The 1619 Project,” or expansive fiction like George Saunders’s “Lincoln in the Bardo” (which includes a staggering 166 narrators). But when it comes to an autobiography, or a personal essay collection, there really is only one best option: Hand the microphone to the author. True, not every voice is cut out to hold an audience for 10 hours, but even when untrained cadences run flat, a self-narrated memoir carries an emotional authenticity that is impossible to replicate.

This archly observed novel, translated from the Italian by Julia MacGibbon, follows some of the conventions of the genre, allowing a well-stocked cast of characters to be buffeted by the history of 20th-century Italy, but it does so in a playful, kaleidoscopic fashion. Here the often wonderfully eccentric minor characters — chauffeurs, nursemaids, household servants — vie for center stage with the equally eccentric bourgeois clans that employ them.

3267,"John Adams reviews “Schoenberg: Why He Matters,” in which Harvey Sachs explores the artistic, academic and spiritual life of a 20th-century cultural giant.","In 1955 Henry Pleasants, a critic of both popular and classical music, issued a cranky screed of a book, “The Agony of Modern Music,” which opened with the implacable verdict that “serious music is a dead art.” Pleasants’s thesis was that the traditional forms of classical music — opera, oratorio, orchestral and chamber music, all constructions of a bygone era — no longer related to the experience of our modern lives. Composers had lost touch with the currents of popular taste, and popular music, with its vitality and its connection to the spirit of the times, had dethroned the classics. Absent the mass appeal enjoyed by past masters like Beethoven, Verdi, Wagner and Tchaikovsky, modern composers had retreated into obscurantism, condemned to a futile search for novelty amid the detritus of a tradition that was, like overworked soil, exhausted and fallow. One could still love classical music, but only with the awareness that it was a relic of the past and in no way representative of our contemporary experience.",Make It New and Difficult: The Music of Arnold Schoenberg,2023-07-28T09:01:36+0000,article,Books,Review,"Books and Literature;Schoenberg: Why He Matters (Book);Sachs, Harvey;Schoenberg, Arnold;Classical Music;Content Type: Personal Profile"

3269,The coming Biden impeachment is a farce.,"When House Republicans return from their recess this fall, they’re likely to have an item on their agenda besides pushing the government toward shutdown: impeaching Joe Biden. “You’ve got to get to the bottom of the truth, and the only way Congress can do that is go to impeachment inquiry,” the Republican House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, said on Tuesday.

3270,"From the essential spirit substitutes and how to mix them to the most striking glasses, everything you need to serve festive zero-proof cocktails.","It’s no secret that nonalcoholic cocktails are suddenly ubiquitous. Whereas until a few years ago, nondrinkers had to make do with cranberry-splashed club soda, now seemingly every noteworthy bar offers a Phony Negroni or a margarita-inspired mocktail. “There are so many people who are nonimbibing, for whatever reason, but who still want to be a part of the mood,” says Stacey Swenson, who designed the menu at the Swan Room bar in downtown Manhattan, which serves drinks including the Champaxne Cocktail (nonalcoholic sparkling wine, orange blossom and bitters) and the Chinola Mule (a tequila alternative with lime, passion fruit and spiced soda). The biggest change: teetotalers aren’t the only ones ordering them. “Nine out of 10 of our customers also drink alcohol,” says Nicholas Bodkins, one of the founders of Boisson, a store specializing in zero-proof spirits. “This is more of an ‘and’ than an ‘or.’” He gives credit for this shift to distillers, who, refining early iterations that often tasted soapy or medicinal, have figured out how to effectively extract the flavors of botanicals without the use of ethanol. Today, the best bitter aperitifs (the term for nonalcoholic alternatives to spirits like Campari and Aperol) have all the complexity and layered flavors of their boozy counterparts. They’re also easy to find — Boisson, for example, has locations in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco and a forthcoming Miami store, in addition to an online shop — which makes stocking a home bar with nonalcoholic options a breeze.
