Count Maui, in Hawaii, among them. Axis deer, an Asian breed, were introduced for hunting in the mid-1900s, and they still attract the sharp-shooting crowd. But as their numbers have grown to the tens of thousands, the deer are also considered to be an invasive menace, not just on the roads, but for the way they denude the landscape of vegetation, causing erosion and water runoffs that can damage coral reefs. Maui Nui, a new company, is now turning them into dinner. Across the island, it harvests wild deer at night so the animals are supposedly less stressed and uses a mobile slaughtering facility. Now various cuts of venison, frozen, in preset combinations that include succulent racks, medallions, strip loins, stew meat for a nice braise and ground venison can be shipped to customers across the United States. The meat is mild-tasting, slightly beefy and tender. It’s also very lean, so add some slab bacon to your stew and plenty of olive oil to the ragù. A four-chop rack serving two will take about 20 minutes at 425 degrees for medium-rare.

Indeed, the pieces were among the most sought-after designs, along with delicate floral-patterned bone-china tea sets and intricate neo-Classical jasperware vases produced by the Potteries, the group of pioneering factories, eventually numbering in the hundreds, established in the 17th century in the coal-mining towns that form the present-day city of Stoke-on-Trent.

Their son, Evan, now 39, began collecting unique precious stones in his 20s. Already working for the family firm by then (he’d designed his first piece for the brand, a pair of cuff links, at age 11), Evan was obsessed with his rare gems — a 50-carat Kazakhstani spinel and a giant museum-quality opal from Lightning Ridge, Australia, among them. “My parents thought I was insane, paying that much for single stones,” he says. He never made them into jewelry, but a few years ago, when the family moved into high jewelry to complement its more accessible designs, Evan, now the chief creative officer, realized it was at last time to part with some of his treasures. So far, he has designed nearly 20 pieces using his private stash, including this white-gold diamond chain necklace with a 31-carat Colombian emerald pendant. He had the gem reconfigured into an antique cushion cut, which contrasts with the modern setting. “It’s vulnerable for me to let these stones go because they’re so personal,” he says. “When they’re gone, they’re gone.”",An Emerald Pendant Plucked From a Designer’s Own Collection,2021-03-17T13:00:08+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Jewels and Jewelry;Yurman, David;Yurman, Sybil;Colombia"

Since 2011, Sciò has been not only the embodiment of these properties’ glamorously Italian spirit but their creative director and C.E.O. Her father, Robert Sciò, bought Hotel Il Pellicano in 1979 from Patricia Graham, an American heiress, and her British husband, Michael, an ex-R.A.F. fighter pilot, who had built it in the mid-60s as a private villa and club. Its languid, sun-bleached charm was immortalized by the photographer Slim Aarons. These days, it is the 44-year-old Sciò who oversees its 47 rooms and two terrace restaurants.

3052,"“Ulysses” and “The Waste Land” appeared in 1922. But three years later, masterworks by Virginia Woolf, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway and John Dos Passos gave the movement its signature forms — and influence.","“An illiterate, underbred book it seems to me: the book of a self-taught working man, & we all know how distressing they are, how egotistic, insistent, raw, striking & ultimately nauseating.” So goes Virginia Woolf’s well-known complaint about “Ulysses,” scribbled into her diary before she had finished reading it. Her disparagement is catnip to those many critics who like to view “Mrs. Dalloway” — that other uber-famous, if more lapidary, modernist novel that spans the course of a single day — as Woolf’s rejoinder to Joyce. More than that, though, it tells us something important about our literary history. Nineteen twenty-two, the year of “Ulysses,” may well be ground zero for the explosion of modernism in literature. But the resultant shock wave is better captured by another year: 1925, that of “Mrs. Dalloway” and several other works, all now in the spotlight in 2021, as they emerge from under copyright.",Was 1925 Literary Modernism’s Most Important Year?,2021-03-20T09:00:03+0000,article,Books,News,"Books and Literature;Writing and Writers;Mrs Dalloway (Book);Woolf, Virginia;Hemingway, Ernest;In Our Time (Book);Fitzgerald, F Scott;The Great Gatsby (Book);Manhattan Transfer (Book);Dos Passos, John"

3241,"Designed in the 1960s by the underrecognized talent Ward Bennett, this Modernist home remains a paragon of minimalism and grace.","AS YOU TURN ONTO Southampton’s Meadow Lane, the green bulwark of privet hedge — a signature of this moneyed enclave — gives way to dune grass, seaside goldenrod and skeletal pines. The five-mile-long finger of land between the Atlantic Ocean and sleepy Shinnecock Bay may be the most prized strip of real estate in the nation, so there is construction everywhere: A new billionaire moves in, tears down the last billionaire’s palace and begins work on yet another Ozymandias. Still, tucked amid these dunes are a handful of modest architectural triumphs, built during a brief gust of Modernism that swept through the area in the mid-20th century. One of them, known as the Sugarman House, a hyperminimalist 1963 concrete shrine of jutting rectangles — part sand castle, part bachelor’s lair — serves as a case study of the work of the underrecognized American designer Ward Bennett.","In Southampton, a Beach House Not Like the Others",2021-03-22T12:00:09+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Historic Buildings and Sites;Design;Interior Design and Furnishings;Southampton (NY);Bennett, Ward;Real Estate and Housing (Residential);Content Type: Personal Profile"

3246,The textile maker Maharam and the design firm 2x4 have conceived a vibrant wall covering that collapses time and space.,"Wall tapestries were commissioned by the Catholic Church in the 13th and 14th centuries to communicate Bible stories to the illiterate masses, but by the Renaissance, they had become aristocratic status symbols. When kings and nobles were defeated in battle, the victor often seized the huge, intricately woven textiles, with their scenes of conflict, village life and mythical beasts, and resized them to fit the walls of their own castles, where they served as both insulation and trophies. Now, Maharam, the textile maker that began at the turn of the 20th century as a fabric pushcart on the streets of Manhattan’s Lower East Side, has reinterpreted the traditional craft. The company collaborated with the New York-based design firm 2x4, which took hundreds of public-domain images of tapestries from the 14th to the 16th centuries to create a 10-by-20-foot digital collage titled Tableau Vivant. Maharam then digitally printed the panorama onto a cellulose and latex substrate that can be applied directly to a wall (smaller sections can be customized to fit any space). From a distance, the work appears to be a museum piece, but up close — where you can see peasants pasted next to unicorns and trees growing at strange angles — it collapses time and space with a psychedelic verve.

3385,A lot has gone right for the new president. Here are three things that could go wrong.,"The first two months of the Biden presidency have gone about as well as anyone in a new administration could reasonably hope. The policy battle over the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill managed the neat trick of simultaneously uniting the Democratic Party, energizing the Biden-skeptical left and putting the Republicans way on the wrong side of public opinion. The vaccination push continues to meet its targets and the “dark winter” wave of new cases receded much faster than the new administration probably anticipated. What will hereafter be known as the “Neera Tanden gambit” appears to have successfully provided cover for the rest of Joe Biden’s cabinet to win approval, widely or narrowly, without bruising conflicts.

Now, this body of work is shedding light on his final days.","RAY JOHNSON ARRIVED in New York City in 1949, still in his early 20s, and lived there for a two-decade span in which the dominant artists in town — abstract painters like Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko and Clyfford Still — came to be regarded, especially by themselves, as seers. Johnson, however, was a prankster. Like the bunny head he adopted as his trademark — a cartoonish line drawing that appeared in much of his work, often bearing the name of a key figure in 20th-century art — he hopped lightly, merrily across this playing field. Reveling in puns and irreverence (an untitled 1973 collage known as “Jackson Pollock Fillets” includes cut-out recipes for Pollock Fillets Amandine and Barbecued Pollock Burgers), conducting his life as a nonstop performance, he revived the Dada tradition embodied by his hero Marcel Duchamp. In contrast to the grandiosity of Minimal art, land art, Pop Art and other macho midcentury movements, he offered something much humbler: collages or drawings of portable size and wry wit. As a response to Happenings, a term coined by Allan Kaprow to describe the participatory performances that flourished in New York in the early ’60s, Johnson staged Nothings, in which a befuddled audience was sometimes greeted with an empty room. He decamped to Long Island in 1968 — residing eventually in a sanctuary in Locust Valley he called the Pink House, though it wasn’t pink — and over the years his ties to his New York friends weakened.",An Elusive Artist’s Trove of Never-Before-Seen Images,2021-03-23T12:00:11+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Art;Photography;Black Mountain College;Johnson, Ray (1927-95);Glen Cove (NY)"

Sutton posted the 35-second video and then closed the app for a few hours to get on with her day.
