In the middle of the night, she beckoned me over to her bed.

She’d held this secret, and now that she was about to die, her conscience got the best of her. She asked me to not tell anyone else in my family. To this day, they think Grandma died in her sleep.

The pieces reflect Paek’s training in animation, film and video at the Rhode Island School of Design — now in New York, she teaches ceramics at Doclay and at Greenwich House, and illustration at the Parsons School of Design — as well as her upbringing.

3545,A pair of charming Gotham-based character comedies are among the highlights of this month’s under-the-radar streaming recommendations.,"“Barbie” is the current commercial and critical triumph of the screenwriting (and real-life) partners Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, and “Frances Ha” is their origin story. But comparatively little ink is spilled these days on their middle feature (which Baumbach directed), a delightfully funny comedy that turns the tropes of the college coming-of-age movie and the Manic Pixie Dream Girl on their heads. Lola Kirke stars as Tracy, a college freshman new to New York City who gets a whirlwind introduction to the city via her soon-to-be-stepsister Brooke (Gerwig). Gerwig and Baumbach’s wise screenplay delicately dramatizes how Brooke first seems like Tracy’s platonic ideal of the young urban woman, then slowly reveals herself as messy in a multitude of ways. Gerwig’s multilayered performance is one of her best, while Baumbach orchestrates the picture’s shifts from character drama to door-slamming farce with bouncy ease.","‘Mistress America,’ ‘Tramps’ and More Streaming Gems",2023-11-29T16:46:52+0000,article,Movies,News,"Movies;Mistress America (Movie);Tramps (Movie);X (Movie);All My Puny Sorrows (Movie);The Zero Theorem (Movie);Love to Love You, Donna Summer (Movie);Wham!
