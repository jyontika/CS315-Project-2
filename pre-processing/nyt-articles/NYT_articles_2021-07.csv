Previously, she was the chef and owner at the Beatrice Inn next door, which she acquired from Graydon Carter. (That restaurant closed this year, and Ms. Mar subsequently decided to open this new place instead of recreating the Beatrice.) Now, defying current restaurant norms — bare tables, no dress code, a burger on the menu — this venture features white napery beneath a chandelier that came from the Waldorf Astoria, a French menu that tilts classic and the requirement that men wear jackets (with a supply of vintage YSL on hand). Though Ms. Mar is known for her artistry with slabs of meat, she isn’t offering steak, preferring seafood and birds. “It’s a vast departure, but what I want right now,” she said. The prix-fixe menu ($185) will change frequently but digs deep into French tradition with frog legs and artichokes in beurre blanc, a mousse of veal brains with truffles, sweetbreads wrapped in cabbage, Dover sole with sorrel mousseline, pithiviers (a pastry dome) of crab, and roast pheasant for two. There will be a croquembouche for dessert. Her inspiration comes from chefs like André Soltner and Jacques Pépin; a painting by Mr. Pépin hangs near the bar. Except for a Hungarian Tokay, the wine list is all French and American, and the salonlike room seats 37, plus nine at the bar. Banquettes in inky blue, which Ms. Mar said was the color of her father’s favorite sweatshirt, contrast the creamy ivory of the walls, and touches of that shade show up in the staff’s Christian Siriano-designed outfits. The restaurant’s name, which translates to the three horses, is a nod to what her family called her and her two brothers.

There’s reimagining the past in both fiction and nonfiction: A tender debut novel sets a taboo love affair in the years after the Civil War, and a book with three authors deconstructs the myths around the Alamo. There are stories about belonging: funny and moving essays about modern queer life, an emotional account of one woman’s experience as a Korean American and the biography of an author who was committed to showing Jewish life in America. Also: Quentin Tarantino turns his recent film about Hollywood history into a novel; a look at how the Federal Writers’ Project captured the country in the 1930s and ’40s; a year in the life of Serena Williams; an insider’s perspective on the contentious issues of law enforcement.",10 New Books We Recommend This Week,2021-07-08T19:44:37+0000,article,Books,List,Books and Literature

It was the first book that I read as I hunkered down in my apartment at the height of the pandemic. Ovid’s cast of human and bestial characters are at the mercy of capricious Gods who constantly change themselves and everything around them into different forms.  These transformations are both beautiful and ghastly, violent and serene — a blurring of boundaries between humans, nature and forces more powerful than ourselves. What inspired me most about the “Metamorphoses” (I read David Raeburn’s classic translation) is how vibrant and visual these stories are, and how Ovid captures human desperation and fragility.  In making these images I wanted to reflect on the idea of becoming something else. Ovid’s physical and emotional landscapes are constantly shifting.

He’s making a type of brioche scented with orange and star anise, another pastry filled with rice pudding and huckleberry jam, and crunchy gougères oozing Comté cheese.

Many have bizarre, almost delusional reasons for not getting vaccinated. Others have fallen prey to misinformation online. Because our patients often take mass transit to their appointments and because our office is in a high-rise and because I offer telehealth appointments, is it ethical and in the interest of public health to restrict vaccine-refusing patients to telehealth appointments?

He was recalling the older actor’s talking about reworking a scene in which his character, the Boston gangster Frank Costello, is supposed to murder a man in a marsh. “Jack looked at that scene” — and, truly, it was almost startling how well Damon captured Nicholson’s disquieting energy — “and he goes: ‘What I did was I made the person being executed a woman.

3995,"A look at this week’s popular novels reminds us that good writing runs in families, wet T-shirts attract attention and you can’t hide from your past.","HOLDING COURT “The Paper Palace” is now in its third week on the hardcover fiction list, partly thanks to a boost from Reese Witherspoon’s book club, and mostly because of Miranda Cowley Heller’s irresistible placement of a complicated family in a bewitching place. Eagle-eyed readers may notice that this tale of gin-soaked backwoods Cape Cod is dedicated to the author’s grandmother Muriel Maurer Cowley, “whose fierce love never wavered.” Fun fact: Heller’s grandfather Malcolm Cowley was a renowned critic, historian, editor, poet, essayist and regular Book Review presence, who died in 1986 at the age of 90. In a 1973 item about one of Cowley’s books, “Works and Days of the Lost Generation,” William Styron quoted his take on the shape and meaning of a literary legacy: “A generation is no more a matter of dates than it is one of ideology. A new generation does not appear every 30 years. … It appears when writers of the same age join in a common revolt against the fathers and when, in the process of adopting a new lifestyle, they find their own models and spokesmen.”",Everything Old Is New Again and Other Best-Selling Wisdom,2021-07-29T09:00:05+0000,article,Books,List,"Books and Literature;The Paper Palace (Book);Cowley Heller, Miranda;Malibu Rising (Book);Reid, Taylor Jenkins;The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo: A Novel (Book);Daisy Jones & The Six (Book);Witherspoon, Reese;Thor, Brad;Black Ice (2021) (Book);Slaughter, Karin (1971- );False Witness (Book)"
