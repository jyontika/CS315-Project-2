110,The Milanese firm Studio Peregalli has tapped into the soul of a 19th-century house in order to return it to an idealized version of its former glory.,"THE ITALIAN WORD patinare is often invoked at Studio Peregalli, the Milanese interior design and architecture firm co-founded by Laura Sartori Rimini and Roberto Peregalli 27 years ago. The term, which translates to “patinate,” is rarely used as a verb in English, generally because it’s something that’s accomplished by time, not by human interference. Yet the dozens of craftsmen trained and employed at the firm are able to create the illusion of age where none exists: scraping, scratching, staining, waxing or soiling walls, floors, furniture and fabrics until each element of each room looks like it’s been around for decades, if not centuries, even though it may in fact be newly reconfigured. Virtually everything that makes it into one of Studio Peregalli’s spaces that’s not already an antique undergoes this process, creating a singular aesthetic that has attracted admirers such as the late French fashion executive Pierre Bergé (the former partner of Yves Saint Laurent), the husband-and-wife American artists John Currin and Rachel Feinstein and the German publisher and philanthropist Hubert Burda.","A Charming Swiss Home That Respects, and Reimagines, the Past",2019-12-02T10:01:28+0000,article,T Magazine,News,Historic Buildings and Sites;ARCHITECTURE;Interior Design and Furnishings;Furniture;ANTIQUES;Switzerland;Milan (Italy);Studio Peregalli

Before it’s over, she has shed her dress and then her Gucci bra, thong and stilettos to address the audience fully nude. “It takes a lot of courage to do what she does,” she said, assuming the voice of an approving critic. “She goes far beyond where most artists have the intelligence or audacity to operate.” The 30-minute piece — funny, brash and often excruciating — ends after the woman, back in her dress but somehow more exposed than ever, breaks down in sobs.",Have We Finally Caught Up With Andrea Fraser?,2019-12-03T10:00:52+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Art;Museums;Collectors and Collections;Petzel Gallery;Fraser, Andrea;Performance Art;Women and Girls"

300,"Michaël Verheyden, who combines simple shapes with rich textures, will show a new collection at Design Miami.","As a student at Belgium’s LUCA School of Arts in the late ’90s, Michaël Verheyden counted the fashion designer Raf Simons as a mentor — he even modeled for Simons before launching his own line of handbags. Yet he graduated with a degree in industrial design, which he put to use when he and his wife, the designer Saartje Vereecke, bought their first home, in Genk, in 2009. After failing to find the sort of furniture they’d envisioned for the space, they started making their own pieces, and have been experimenting with clean-lined forms ever since. Verheyden’s latest collection, Archetypes, a 20-piece range that the Belgian gallerist Pierre Marie Giraud is showing at Design Miami, includes brass lamps, marble tables and a classic oak screen. It was inspired by the work of Donald Judd and Jean-Michel Frank, and, like them, Verheyden is interested in simple structures, but also in rich textures. “If I design a chair, I want people to recognize its basic shape — but then I like to play with the materials,” he says. Indeed, the collection’s benchlike sofa is strung with Manila cord and sits atop gouged oak legs evoking snakeskin, while a decorative brass bowl is polished smooth in parts but left rough and unfinished at its base. With his Tabula Runda writing desk, though, Verheyden plays with form as well: It contains two hidden drawers and legs that have been moved from the edges to the center, challenging our notions of just what an ideal table might be. As Verheyden says, “The answer is always to look at something long enough to see how I might change it.”",A Furniture Designer Who Learned Under Raf Simons,2019-12-03T16:00:07+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Verheyden, Michael;Furniture;Design;Tables;Desks;Simons, Raf;Belgium"

And while Nick maintains his innocence, it becomes clear that Amy may not be a reliable narrator. Based on the 2012 novel by Gillian Flynn, who also wrote the screenplay, “Gone Girl” is “a ghastly vision,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her New York Times review.

The country’s isolated southern island state has been so overlooked in the past, it’s even been left off maps of Australia. In recent years, however, Australians have changed their tune. Tasmania is experiencing a surge of weekenders and property buyers, driven by a newfound interest in its pristine nature, unhurried way of life and an increasingly diverse food and art scene that really started to take off with the arrival, in a Hobart suburb, of the Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) in 2011. The biggest transformation has taken place in the once-sleepy capital of Hobart, which now boasts a plethora of creative new restaurants and an edgy spirit, particularly during the winter Dark Mofo festival. (A highlight: the nude solstice swim in the chilly River Derwent.) Tasmania’s profile is rising overseas, as well. International visitors jumped by 21 percent from mid-2017 to mid-2018 — the biggest rise by far of any Australian state. Tasmanians have always known how good the life is here.

There’s Melvin Konner’s “Believers,” which looks for scientific and psychological explanations for the persistence of faith, and, less overtly but no less appealingly, the questing and philosophical poems in Charles Wright’s “Oblivion Banjo.” Any of those might do nicely to set the mood this week, as readers of various faiths and denominations hurtle toward their high holidays.",11 New Books We Recommend This Week,2019-12-05T21:47:58+0000,article,Books,List,Books and Literature

1349,"Through the back of Vacheron Constantin’s luxurious new timepiece, you can see what makes it tick.","History often treats the engineering marvels of the 21st century as exponentially more virtuosic than what came before, but consider the tourbillon. Created in 1795 by the Paris-based watchmaker Abraham-Louis Breguet, a favorite of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, the mechanism (French for “whirlwind”) is perhaps the most esoteric and elegant watch complication ever conceived. Born of horology’s obsession with maintaining accuracy to the millisecond, the tourbillon counteracts the effect of the earth’s gravity by constantly rotating the cage that holds the timepiece’s balance wheel, balance spring and escapement while the movement is running. The idea was to eliminate errors in rate — the loss or gain in time that would arise if the watch stayed too long in one position — by crafting an internal apparatus that continually turned on an axis. Such a marvel of intricacy must be witnessed to be fully understood: It is as transfixing as watching a heart beat. In this new incarnation by the Swiss company Vacheron Constantin, which has specialized in rarefied timepieces since its founding in 1755, you can stare at it all you want through the round porthole at the bottom of the blue lacquer dial or through its sapphire crystal back. Because the case is fashioned from stainless steel instead of the platinum or gold used for most tourbillon watches, this exemplar of late 18th-century ingenuity seems decidedly contemporary — and, perhaps, ever so slightly less beyond our grasp.

It also sells high-fidelity transcriptions of dishes from the chefs Ferran Adrià, whose liquid olives are still blowing minds, and his brother, Albert, who fed recipes to the outstanding pastry department. Somehow, though, the most impressive foods are the most elementary: the gazpacho that shimmers with olive oil and sherry vinegar; the thick, dark hot chocolate that comes with churros just out of the fryer; the goblets of gin and tonics.

And because of that, we get mad before we get logical.” She’s talking about a snarky reply she got to a social media post she made about otters (of all things), but the observation also addresses the reason many people now know who Wolf is: Last year, she was catapulted to national prominence after delivering a piercing monologue at the White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner. Some celebrated the routine. Some denounced it. Looking back on the evening in a recent interview with The New York Times, Wolf mentioned just one regret: “I would maybe go harder.” She presumably had more freedom to push boundaries in her streaming “Joke Show,” in which she addresses subjects like manspreading, gender equality and the physical fitness (or lack thereof) of some past presidents. “I say this all the time: Don’t bring your baggage into my joke,” Wolf said in the interview with The Times. “A comic’s job isn’t to be right or wrong. They’re just supposed to be funny.”",What’s on TV Wednesday: A Michelle Wolf Special and ‘Moonlight Sonata’,2019-12-11T06:00:08+0000,article,Arts,News,Television;Movies

1472,"Known for its intelligence-gathering operations during World War II, the O.S.S. also helped shape the look of modern life.","THE OFFICE OF STRATEGIC SERVICES was the first centralized foreign intelligence agency in the United States, the direct precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency. Founded during World War II by order of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the O.S.S. (or the Coordinator of Information, as it was originally called) was established “to collect, analyze, and correlate information and data bearing on national security, to make such data available to the President and such other officials as determined by the President, and to perform related supplementary activities.” And yet its role soon became much larger and more influential. The head of the O.S.S., Colonel William “Wild Bill” Donovan, quickly realized that the information produced by the global war, fought on multiple fronts and territories, needed to be painstakingly abstracted, graphically depicted and efficiently presented. The O.S.S. mission expanded to include not only information gathering through research and counterintelligence but also packaging and interpreting that information for the president and other key decision makers. Propaganda played a crucial role during World War II, with the O.S.S. leading efforts to demoralize the enemy and encourage resistance in Axis-controlled countries. They created a stamp bearing the face of Hitler rendered as a skull, produced radio broadcasts in German, spread pamphlets announcing a German general’s resignation and made films for new military recruits, such as the Hollywood producer Darryl F. Zanuck’s circa 1943 “Organization of the Army,” which was commissioned by General George C. Marshall. Through its manipulation of the art of information, the agency helped shape the look and philosophy of American imperialism. In doing so, the O.S.S. assembled a concentration of acumen and talent that rivaled those of the iconic schools and institutes that propagated design in the 20th century.

1626,A romantic comedy with Charlize Theron and Seth Rogen airs on HBO. And a documentary about Caroll Spinney is streaming on Topic.,"LONG SHOT (2019) 10:10 p.m. on HBO. Love blooms in the din of an underground bomb shelter in this romantic comedy, which stars Charlize Theron as a United States secretary of state running for president and Seth Rogen as a journalist who becomes her beau. The “long shot” in the title refers to both the presidential bid and the unlikely romance that the pair develops: Charlotte (Theron) used to babysit Fred (Rogen). Their meet-cute adult reunion happens at a lavish charity event, where Fred (the only neon windbreaker in a sea of suits) manages to trip down a staircase in front of an assembly of distinguished guests. The rest of the story involves Charlotte hiring Fred as a speechwriter and a journey abroad that lands the pair in that snug bomb shelter. “Much of what happens isn’t surprising,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times, “but Dan Sterling and Liz Hannah’s script is consistently, genially funny, filled with patter and nonsense, and spiked with sincerity and a few gross-out flourishes.” The movie was directed by Jonathan Levine, who also directed Rogen in “50/50” and “The Night Before.”",What’s on TV Thursday: ‘Long Shot’ and ‘I Am Big Bird’,2019-12-12T06:00:09+0000,article,Arts,News,Television;Movies

1826,A “Transformers” prequel hits Amazon and Hulu. And a documentary about Mel Brooks airs on HBO.,"BUMBLEBEE (2018) Stream on Amazon and Hulu. Many blockbuster prequels tell the origin story of a flesh-and-blood superhero or villain. This one tells the tale of a Volkswagen Beetle. Or, more precisely, it tells an origin story of a robot hero who can morph into a yellow car. That robot would be Bumblebee, once the metal partner of Shia LaBeouf’s character in the various Michael Bay “Transformers” movies. Bumblebee is here reimagined as the sidekick of a 1980s Northern California teenager played by Hailee Steinfeld. Together, the pair defends the earth from evil robots. This movie was directed by Travis Knight, a filmmaker who built his career on stop-motion animation. He cut back on some of the profuse chaos that defined the earlier “Transformers” films, working off a screenplay by Christina Hodson. The result, Glenn Kenny wrote in his review for The New York Times, is “cleverly plotted, neatly allusive and has dialogue you can envision real people and, um, real Transformers speaking.” It’s “springy yet coherent,” he added, “not, like previous films in the series, a digital-image blender set on high.”",What’s on TV Friday: ‘Bumblebee’ and ‘Mel Brooks: Unwrapped’,2019-12-13T06:00:07+0000,article,Arts,News,Television;Movies

A twitchy second hand probably means you’re looking at a quartz-movement watch powered by a battery. Altieri specializes in Rolexes, which almost always run on automatic movement, where the motion of a wearer’s wrist winds an intricate system of tiny gears and springs, resulting in a smoother, sweeping second hand. Altieri can make out a cheap quartz fake from five feet away, but recently he has seen more almost-perfect impostors, what he calls “superfakes.” To catch these, you need a 10x magnifying glass and lots of time. “It really helps if you have a real one right next to it to compare,” he says.

As a rock music fan, she strove to channel the D.I.Y. ethos laid out in the self-taught musician Viv Albertine’s 2014 feminist punk memoir “Clothes, Clothes, Clothes. Music, Music, Music. Boys, Boys, Boys.” The resulting pieces — a collection of youthful, boldly hued knits made from merino and lamb’s wool and adorned with the knitted names of beloved bands such as Devo and Joy Division — quickly found a following on Instagram. Last year, Holland won the British Fashion Council’s Fashion Potential Award, and while the brand’s international profile is growing, she is committed to working with British and family-run businesses, both in the Pennine mountains of Yorkshire, where her yarn is milled, and in Hawick, Scotland, where her sweaters are crafted by hand. For recent collections, she has drawn inspiration from sources including Virginia Woolf’s 1925 novel “Mrs. Dalloway” (which prompted woven slogans like “melancholy” and “true self”) and the color combinations found on old covers of The Paris Review. This season, a holiday in Greece was her starting point: While in Athens this past summer, she recalls, “We stayed with friends in the historically anarchic suburb of Exarcheia.” The collection’s standout piece, the Carrington cardigan, plays with the same fusion of tradition and rebellion.

Tombstones, darkness and cold all feature prominently in this bleak Charles Dickens rethink. Created for FX and BBC One by Steven Knight (best known for “Peaky Blinders”), this three-part, not-for-kids version of the Christmas staple stars Guy Pearce as Ebenezer Scrooge, who travels back to his childhood with the Ghost of Christmas Past (given eerie form here by Andy Serkis). The journey touches on some heavy subjects: sexual abuse, neglect (particularly by Scrooge’s father, played by Johnny Harris) and other cruelties. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Knight explained the reasoning behind some of the show’s more disturbing elements — like the abuse — that make for an especially troubling telling of the story. “I wanted to look at these things, not to disrupt or be shocking, but to say the things one can say now,” he said. “I am trying to make some suggestions about why Scrooge is Scrooge.”",What’s on TV Thursday: ‘A Christmas Carol’ and ‘Cold Case Hammarskjold’,2019-12-19T06:00:11+0000,article,Arts,News,Television;Movies

Holy men bond, quarrel and drink Fanta in this papal dramedy, which casts two seasoned British actors — Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Pryce — as Catholic leaders with clashing social beliefs. Directed by Fernando Meirelles (“The Constant Gardener”) from a screenplay by Anthony McCarten (“Bohemian Rhapsody”), the movie focuses on the relationship between Pope Benedict XVI (Hopkins) and the future Pope Francis, Jorge Bergoglio (Pryce), during a period when Benedict was nearing retirement and Bergoglio was moving toward becoming his successor. “‘The Two Popes’ is really three movies: a behind-the-scenes tale of Vatican politics, a mini-biopic about the current pontiff, and a two-man study of friendship, rivalry and major British acting,” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. “The first, though intriguing, is more puzzling than illuminating. The second feels a bit like a Wikipedia page, albeit one with first-rate cinematography. The third is absolutely riveting, a subtle and engaging double portrait that touches on complicated matters of faith, ambition and moral responsibility.”",What’s on TV Friday: ‘The Two Popes’ and ‘The Aeronauts’,2019-12-20T06:00:12+0000,article,Arts,News,Television;Movies

3375,Willem Dafoe stars in an adventure movie on Disney Plus. And a PBS program looks at Christmastime in Tudor England.,"TOGO (2019) Stream on Disney Plus. Willem Dafoe throws on a fur coat and hat and takes to the snow-covered mountains in this adventure film, which has skipped theaters in favor of a debut on Disney’s new streaming service. The movie is based on the 1925 serum run, during which antitoxins were transported hundreds of miles by dog sled to fight a deadly disease outbreak in Nome, Alaska — in the middle of a brutal winter storm. It’s often associated with Balto, the dog that completed the run (and got a 1990s big-screen animated feature out of the deal). The new movie focuses on a different dog, Togo, and his trainer and musher (played by Dafoe). The story creates drama from a classic combination of heroism and harsh conditions. “It’s going to be bad,” Dafoe’s character says early in the film, sizing up the coming storm. How bad? “Memorable, I think.”",What’s on TV Wednesday: ‘Togo’ and ‘The Witcher’,2019-12-25T06:00:06+0000,article,Arts,News,Television;Movies

3436,The soapy serial-killer series “You” returns on Netflix. And Céline Sciamma’s “Girlhood” is streaming on Criterion Channel.,"YOU Stream on Netflix. “Love has taken me to dark places,” the charming serial killer Joe Goldberg (Penn Badgley) says early in the new season of this series. “But Los Angeles has got to be as dark as it gets.” Originally a Lifetime series, “You” picked up steam near the beginning of the year after its first season became available on Netflix. That season played something like “Dexter” crossed with a soap opera: It followed Joe, a killer, as he pursued a romantic obsession in New York City (the relationship didn’t pan out). The new, second season moves the action to the West Coast. It gives Joe a job at a gourmet market and a fresh fixation: a co-worker played by Victoria Pedretti. “The new location allows the showrunner, Sera Gamble, and her staff to add Southern California stereotypes to the generational and class formulas that draw Joe’s scorn,” Mike Hale wrote in his review of the second season for The New York Times, “and to throw the Hollywood melodrama into the genre blender along with the rom-com.” He called the show “one of television’s more addictive treats.”",What’s on TV Thursday: ‘You’ and ‘Girlhood’,2019-12-26T06:00:06+0000,article,Arts,News,Television;Movies

3634,Three Federal Reserve rate cuts and a rally in huge tech stocks like Apple have helped lift the S&P 500 by 29 percent so far in 2019.,"The world is enmeshed in a trade war. The president has been impeached. The tech industry is under attack from regulators worldwide. But this year investors said: So what? The stock market is closing in on its best year in two decades. With only two days of trading to go, the S&P 500 could fare better than it has since 1997. Stock prices have been buoyed by a mere whiff of optimism that the economy — despite occasional hiccups and dire prognostications by so-called experts — will keep chugging along. And the Federal Reserve deserves credit, too, for cutting interest rates despite scowls from a White House that wanted more. So far this year, the S&P is up 29 percent. But the market crept up gradually as investors felt their way through the turbulent year, interrupted only by a handful of short-lived retreats. Since mid-October, stocks haven’t had a single daily gain of more than 1 percent. Even on Friday, the increase was tiny, but it left the index at a record and capped a fifth consecutive week of gains.",Stocks Are on the Verge of the Best Year Since 1997,2019-12-27T20:57:14+0000,article,Business Day,News,Stocks and Bonds;Two Thousand Nineteen;United States Economy;Interest Rates;International Trade and World Market

The effect was to leave an impression with many readers that Mr. Stephens was arguing that Jews are genetically superior. That was not his intent. He went on instead to argue that culture and history are crucial factors in Jewish achievements and that, as he put it, “At its best, the West can honor the principle of racial, religious and ethnic pluralism not as a grudging accommodation to strangers but as an affirmation of its own diverse identity. In that sense, what makes Jews special is that they aren’t. They are representational.”","Editors’ Note: Dec. 31, 2019",2019-12-31T04:17:39+0000,article,Corrections,Correction,
