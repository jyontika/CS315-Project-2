Sunday evenings are black holes from which no hope escapes; a time of rumination on the failures of the past seven days, and pre-emptive haunting by fiascos to come.

It’s a little bit of a scramble to get out the door, but I can’t wake up without taking a shower. I’ll use Éminence Monoi Age Corrective Exfoliating Cleanser, followed by Dior Capture Totale Le Sérum and Dior Prestige La Crème. I try to slather myself in those, and then another big slather of Kiehl’s Avocado Eye Cream and Carmex Classic Lip Balm. I don’t wash my hair every day but, when I do, I use Alba Botanica So Smooth Gardenia Conditioner. (I don’t use shampoo.) I always scrunch Kiehl’s Creme With Silk Groom into wet hair and then wind it up with these discontinued Scunci Clips to set — I’ve resorted to buying them on eBay. I started pinning my hair up to control the curl, and now it’s become my signature. It is pretty healthy because it’s tucked away all the time but, when it starts to feel gangly, I’ll snip it myself. I almost never wear makeup because my day starts so early. If I do, I’ll do a cat eye with Stila Stay All Day Waterproof Liquid Eyeliner, Diorshow Mascara and, sometimes, Rouge Dior 999 lipstick. Other lipsticks I rotate in are Stila Stay All Day Liquid Lipstick and Clinique Almost Lipstick in Black Honey. I’ll use Weleda Gentle Cleansing Milk to wash it off at night and, sometimes, I use this Borghese Purifying Mud Mask — I’ve had a jar of that forever. I don’t get massages enough, but I need to. I threw out my back recently, and a massage at Element spa in Brooklyn helped me get back on my feet. A lot of my team has favorite hand creams that are around the studio, one being Aesop Reverence Aromatique Hand Balm, so I’ll use those. One thing I use often is this hand wash that is used to remove sap and resin. The filth if we don’t wear gloves is incredible, it just gets into your pores, and this really removes it. Working with flowers and sometimes rotting flowers, I like to be aware of smells, so I don’t wear fragrance very often. What I do love to wear is Hermès Eau d’Orange Verte.

Putting his Ph.D. in chemistry to good use, Rivillo experimented with natural dyes (such as spirulina and paprika) to find those that would maintain their hue even when dried or cooked and posted his work on Instagram. Now, Rivillo, who recently left his job as a nanotechnology researcher to pursue the project full time, sells his creations (from $40 for 2.1 ounces, plus shipping).

2657,Anyone familiar with the concept of the “1990s” might recognize the cunning of this poem’s slacker mood.,"Poetry’s supposed timelessness means that we sometimes overlook its capacity to memorialize a precise moment, but Peter Gizzi’s “In Defense of Nothing” — an earlier poem from this major American poet’s long career — reminds me that poetry, too, is a seismograph of vibes. Anyone familiar with the concept of the “1990s” might recognize the cunning of this poem’s slacker mood — the whatever and the wonder precisely calibrated, neither one of them surrendering fully to the other. It’s a road poem too: full of the sideways views of trees and trailers, the landscape lived at Interstate speed. This cool mix of understatement and awe, of industrial society and its atoms, preserves the poem’s present. It’s important and accurate that the poem ends with a hint of ironic and plaintive liberation — a power line, a poetic line “broken free.” Selected by Anne Boyer",Poem: In Defense of Nothing,2023-02-23T10:00:10+0000,article,Magazine,News,Poetry and Poets;Nineteen Hundred Nineties

For her debut, she looked to an old favorite for inspiration: Eero Saarinen’s Miller House and Garden, which “represents the modernity, simplicity and openness that I value in my clothing design,” she says. Located in Columbus, Ind., the midcentury modern home features a single-story open layout ideal for communal gatherings, as well as details meant to enhance the individual dwellers’ day-to-day lives. “I love the idea of this house being a space that is intensely personal, but is also a really beautiful home for entertaining,” says Giardina. Similarly, the wardrobe she created is for “both private and public moments.” (An organic Supima cotton track pant and matching tunic work just as well for lounging at home as they do under the brand’s blazers for the office.) The cushions that adorn the house’s famous conversation pit provided a palette of saturated reds, creams and pinks, while the garden, designed by Dan Kiley, offered a range of fern, olive and sage greens and lilac-tinted blues for Giardina to draw from. (Saarinen and Kiley also collaborated on the St. Louis Arch, in Giardina’s hometown.) Another aim of the spring collection was to expand Another Tomorrow’s range of textures — Giardina added new materials like hemp linen and even cruelty-free silk. anothertomorrow.co",An Edinburgh Shop That Celebrates Scottish Design,2023-02-23T14:00:07+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Zimbabwe;Fashion and Apparel;Accessories (Apparel);Interior Design and Furnishings;Saarinen, Eero"

Everything has been going well, except she is dating an inmate who was convicted of murdering one of his family members. This inmate is somebody we knew when we were younger; our friend group was very affected by the murder. I have my own personal trauma with the inmate, and I know my roommate does as well. He is really not a great guy. But my roommate is convinced the inmate has changed. She tells me details about their relationship, as friends do. It’s clear to me he hasn’t changed much. I avoid talking about him as much as possible and change the subject if he is brought up. Although he still has 11 years left on his sentence, he is trying to appeal for a lesser term. I am hopeful their relationship will end before he is released. Otherwise, I fear for her safety; I can see the red flags every day. What do I do to help? My family tells me that if I try to talk to her about it, I will just push her away. But I’m having a hard time just standing by. — Name Withheld",My Friend Is Dating a Murderer.

Then she leads you to discover a panoply of tastes and techniques, including rectangular slab pies filled with fruit or cheese; folded yeast-raised plum pastries made with lard and butter; pear cake scented with sage; and pull-apart buns, like monkey bread. More familiar are Austrian and Hungarian items, including strudels, and some entries from the Jewish repertoire: “Jewish cookies with plum butter,” a.k.a. hamantaschen for Purim (starting on March 6), and perhaps the best noodle kugel you’re likely to try, a recipe from Transylvania crackling with phyllo. The histories of the many nationalities that inhabit the region and that have contributed to the table are outlined in rich detail. Shortcomings? She calls mostly for medium eggs but fails to say you can substitute large; and pan-sizes are often odd, so some adapting is necessary.
