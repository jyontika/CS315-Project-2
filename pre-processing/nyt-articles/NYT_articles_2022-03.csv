The name refers to the former Del Posto and Daniel chef Melissa J. Rodriguez, who is partnering with Jeff Katz and James Kent of Crown Shy and Saga to develop this sprawling space. (Al Coro, a lavish Italian restaurant, and Discolo, a lower-level lounge, will open in the Del Posto space in early summer.) Mel’s is done warmly in orange tones and polished light wood, a bar and a dining counter open into a rear dining room, and a huge wood-fired pizza oven is central to the space. “Everything is cooked with wood,” Ms. Rodriguez said. “There’s no gas here.” The pizzas start with Margherita but quickly veer into creative territory: mushrooms, smoked mozzarella and shaved shallots; and kale, basil pesto, ricotta and preserved lemon. Many appetizers, like roasted parsnips with robiola cheese, roasted maitake mushrooms with soppressata piccante, and charred shrimp, are wood fired, as are mains like whole fish, whole roasted cauliflower and strip steak. Unlike at most pizzerias, dessert is neither an afterthought nor skippable. Consider milk chocolate gelato with dark chocolate sable swirl; salted caramel and fior di latte gelato with caramel sauce and shortbread crumble; or an Italian rainbow cookie hot fudge sundae, a tribute to Little Italy. The timing of the opening is calculated so that Ms. Rodriguez, a Culinary Institute of America graduate, has several months to get Mel’s in order before Al Coro is unveiled.

The type called Wild look about the same as the Garden ones, but they are winners with a lovely perfume and a bright, tart sweetness.

As if the result of a solo game of exquisite corpse, these composite creatures are oddly proportioned and at turns alluring and unsettling.

2472,Suggested reading from critics and editors at The New York Times.,"Disruption! Chaos! Pandemonium! It’s not much fun to live through, but in hindsight it can make for pretty good copy — so it’s not surprising to find, at the center of this week’s recommended titles, that the center doesn’t hold. NoViolet Bulawayo’s new novel, “Glory,” is all about political turmoil. Yoko Tawada’s latest, “Scattered All Over the Earth,” is about climate apocalypse. Two new biographies of Buster Keaton make the case that he was not only a comic genius but also a technological disrupter, madly innovating new directions for the film industry in its early days. And in “Origin,” Jennifer Raff sets out to overturn some long-held theories about the first humans to populate the Americas. Things fall apart. That’s the message of “The Quiet Before,” by Gal Beckerman (until recently my colleague at the Book Review), about social movements building from the ground up, and it’s the premise (in a very different way) of “The Old Woman With the Knife,” Gu Byeong-mo’s novel about a 65-year-old female assassin in Seoul. Meanwhile, disruption of another sort — aesthetic, existential — is at the core of the Swedish writer Jon Fosse’s seven-novel series “Septology,” about an aging painter arguing with God.

Available for pre-order, it’s a timely memorial, tracing her life in California through the kitchens she experienced and ran. Notably, there’s the French Laundry, which she and her husband, Don, originally owned from 1978 to 1994, when Thomas Keller took over. The first kitchen in the book was her mother’s, the final one Elk Cottage, in Mendocino, Calif., where the Schmitts retired and she cooked for the two of them. The recipes woven throughout are almost book ended by the simplest from her mother: potatoes simmered then roasted to a crisp with a mustard slather; and sausages in hard cider, a two-ingredient marvel. The book, illustrated with photographs and memorabilia, is filled with often inventive but always ingredient-driven dishes, including many for duck. Some are written with step-by-step directions — two pages for a turkey sandwich! — that convey a sense that Ms. Schmitt is at your side offering handy tips. Her French Laundry recipes are pulled from daily five-course menus: warm salad of sweetbreads and mushrooms; roasted rib-eye of veal; and rhubarb mousse, nothing precious. Also described are the Vintage Café, the Chutney Kitchen and the Apple Farm, where teaching and catering mostly replaced nightly dinners.

I had never heard of Jane Campion’s “The Power of the Dog” until Sam Elliott decided that it does not qualify as a cowboy movie. Elliott is one of those character actors who seem to have subsumed his core identity into the roles he has played in dozens of movies and television shows. It is cool to lust for Elliott — gruff, masculine, western, small-c conservative, with a mustache made for pornography — or, rather, for the type of masculinity he performs. Women and gay men and nonbinary people frequently remark on his appeal. While that appeal might have a daddy-issues vibe, it is also nostalgic for an old-school movie star masculinity that was problematic in its own time (the patriarchal colonialism!) and that has been now defanged in the #MeToo era. The anachronism of Elliott’s cowboy archetype makes him safe enough to lust after.",Decoding Jane Campion’s Joke About the Williams Sisters,2022-03-21T19:16:38+0000,article,Opinion,Op-Ed,"internal-sub-only-nl;Williams, Serena;Williams, Venus;Campion, Jane;Elliott, Sam;Critics Choice Awards"

3163,It was renovating his home in London that helped Enis Karavil hone his aesthetic and led him to start his own design business.,"In 2012, after graduating from the Inchbald School of Design in London, the Turkish designer Enis Karavil was living in the city’s Belgravia neighborhood and working nearby — for the London Design Festival — at the Victoria and Albert Museum. He spent much of his weekends, however, a few miles northwest in Notting Hill, browsing at Portobello Market, which consists of a mile-long string of street vendors who have been congregating there since the late 1860s, and which, thanks to the so-called rag and bone men — essentially, cart-wielding junk dealers — has over the last eight decades evolved into an epicenter for antiques and eccentric bric-a-brac. Eventually, Karavil’s frequent excursions, as well as the neighborhood’s vibrant atmosphere, spurred him to look for a place in Notting Hill. First, he put an offer on a three-story London villa, but then he saw an apartment that spanned two floors of a stucco-fronted townhouse built in the mid-19th century. Though it needed considerable love, he knew, largely thanks to an original marble fireplace with neo-Classical corbel detailing and an unusual wrought-iron spiral staircase, that it was where he wanted to be.",An Elegant Notting Hill Flat Enlivened By Maximalist Flourishes,2022-03-23T16:38:34+0000,article,T Magazine,News,London (England);Interior Design and Furnishings;Furniture;Home Repairs and Improvements;Antiques;Design

Raised on Manhattan’s Upper East Side by an Austrian mother and a Hungarian father, she spent her childhood days wandering through museums and art galleries with her family. As a student at LaGuardia High School of Music and Art, Kosann would head downtown after class to rummage through antiques stores. At 16, the gift of a Rollei film camera from her father changed her life. Inspired by Alfred Stieglitz and Edward Steichen, she spent the next two decades taking portraits of friends and acquaintances. Her love of old, beautiful things never faded, and she amassed in that time “about a gazillion” Art Deco cigarette cases, powder compacts, Victorian lockets and minaudières from the early 1900s, which she acquired at the Marché aux Puces de Saint-Ouen in Paris, along Portobello Road in London and down Vienna’s cobblestone side streets. Kosann would insert her photos into what she called “image cases,” and give them as presents to friends, and by 2003, she launched her namesake line of sterling silver photo boxes. She eventually expanded into jewelry, offering oval filigree lockets, enamel vermeil zodiac charms and stackable gold bands that riff on 15th-century poesy rings.",A Teardrop Locket Inspired by a Parisian Flea Market Find,2022-03-25T12:00:08+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Antiques;Jewels and Jewelry;Kosann, Monica Rich"

3901,They are best consumed as escapist fantasies about a mythic figure I myself could never embody: the femme fatale.,"I can trace my fascination with erotic thrillers back to the 1998 Neve Campbell and Denise Richards vehicle “Wild Things.” My father and I watched it together at his suggestion (there was never much censorship in my bohemian Manhattan childhood home), and as a burgeoning teen cinephile I was enchanted by its polished, artful sleaze. The plot concerns Campbell (brunette, surly, poor) and Richards (blonde, popular, wealthy), who accuse their high-school guidance counselor of abuse. Soon, the story becomes a thicket of convoluted double crosses, and nothing is what it originally seemed.
