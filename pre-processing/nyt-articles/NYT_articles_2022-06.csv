141,A show at the Metropolitan Museum presents us with what is in many ways a whole new artist whose achievement in painting will need to be factored into art history.,"It is one thing to know that Louise Bourgeois made paintings. There are often a few of them in surveys of her long career as a sculptor, which reached its apogee in the 1980s and ’90s. It is something else to learn that in the 1940s — her first decade in New York — she made more than 100 paintings. Nearly half of them are now heating up a large gallery at the Metropolitan Museum of Art with raw emotion, awkward paint handling and adamantine colors — most often brilliant to dark shades of blue and especially red. In fact, this show is an insightful meditation on the roiling significance of red, whose many associations include blood, passion, love, courage, joy, anger, violence.","Louise Bourgeois, Celebrated Sculptor, Unsung Painter",2022-06-01T23:43:00+0000,article,Arts,Review,"Art;Bourgeois, Louise;Metropolitan Museum of Art;Paris (France)"

As Paula Byrne points out in her capacious biography, Pym’s annus horribilis was the same 1963 Larkin satirized in his poem “Annus Mirabilis,” as the year sex “began” in the U.K., bookended by “the end of the Chatterley ban” — when the courts ruled Lawrence’s famous novel non-obscene and freely publishable — “And the Beatles’ first LP.”",An Excellent Woman?

1064,"Ruangrupa, an Indonesian group of collaborators, turns social experiences into art.

Its population of 217,796 inhabits a central German valley, hundreds of miles from Berlin or Munich. Its parks and palaces are Teutonic-prim. People eat their lunchtime kebabs on a plaza opposite the squat, sober Fridericianum, one of Europe’s oldest public art museums. The local football team, KSV Hessen Kassel, languishes in the fourth tier of the German league. But on the half-decade, when Kassel hosts Documenta, arguably the world’s largest exhibition of contemporary art, nearly a million visitors pour in over 100 summer days. The Fridericianum is the nucleus, but Documenta annexes the entire town — shops, gardens, warehouses, streets — leaving relics behind. A wanderer may be art-struck without warning. Once, walking by the Fulda River, I encountered a Claes Oldenburg sculpture, from a Documenta in 1982: a tremendous blue pickax planted bit-first into the soil.",A Radical Collective Takes Over One of the World’s Biggest Art Shows,2022-06-09T09:00:22+0000,article,Magazine,News,"Art;ruangrupa (Art Collective);Gudskul (Nonprofit);Documenta GmbH;Darmawan, Ade;Indonesia;Jakarta (Indonesia);Kassel (Germany);Content Type: Personal Profile"

It severed its ties with the Paris location, began renovations and has reinvented itself as Chambers. David Lillie, an owner of Chambers Street Wines, remains a partner, along with the beverage director, Pascaline Lepeltier, an award-winning French sommelier; the general manager, Jared David, who had that role at Racines NY; and Jonathan Karis, a former chef de cuisine at Gramercy Tavern and the new executive chef. He describes his food as home cooking, though partly boning a chicken and serving it richly marinated and sizzled on a plancha might not be a home cook’s idea of weeknight dinner. Nonetheless, his food is homier than Racines’s. Black bass with braised artichokes and saffron seasoning, grilled sweetbreads with sauerkraut, Little Gem lettuce with a creamy feta dressing and, for dessert, a phyllo mille-feuille with honey-lemon mascarpone are some other dishes he’s planning. Though the restaurant maintains its substantial cellar, the working wine list is brief, rotates seasonally and has an eye on the environment, with an interest in who made the wine and how. Ms. Lepeltier plans to feature hybrid grapes and have wines from Red Hook Winery and others on tap. “I don’t want to serve wines for the 1 percent,” she said. The renovations have resulted in a somewhat more gracious and coherent space framed by curved pale wood panels, brick walls, a long marble bar, a roomier dining counter at the open kitchen and a communal table in front.

3058,"Inventive riffs on murder mysteries, westerns and gangster movies are among the highlights of this month’s under-the-radar streaming recommendations.","The director Albert Shin lays on the dread from the opening frames of this atmospheric Canadian thriller; something’s wrong here, even if we don’t yet know what. Abby (Tuppence Middleton) doesn’t know either, but she has spent most of her life haunted by the childhood incident that begins the film: a half-understood encounter at a lake during which she might have witnessed a kidnapping. Now, as an adult whose life is falling apart, she does what so many of us do: She ignores her own problems and becomes fixated on the increasingly peculiar details of a barely remembered incident. Shin has a way of unsettlingly creeping his camera and peering inquisitively into darkness (literal and figurative); the result is a solid, moody mystery about buried secrets and oddball history. Bonus: an appropriately odd appearance by the Canadian treasure David Cronenberg as a grizzled podcaster.","‘Disappearance at Clifton Hill,’ ‘Damsel’ and More Streaming Gems",2022-06-22T16:01:52+0000,article,Movies,News,Movies;Damsel (Movie);Martha Marcy May Marlene (Movie);Summerland (Movie);Tony Hawk: Until the Wheels Fall Off (Movie);Ash Is Purest White (Movie);Muscle Shoals (Movie);White God (Movie);Disappearance at Clifton Hill (Movie)

3824,Choose something in your range. Avoid cold drinks to save your throat.,"“Don’t sing ‘I Will Always Love You’ if you cannot hit those notes,” says Garvaundo Hamilton, 33, who won the Karaoke World Championships in 2020. Just because you like a song does not mean you should sing it. Many classic songs should probably be avoided unless you’re a trained vocalist with an expansive range — including all of Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Celine Dion, Journey and Queen, particularly “Bohemian Rhapsody.” If you want to sound good, he also suggests caution when attempting “rap that’s really too fast for you.” Hamilton, a general manager at a print shop in Seattle, goes out to karaoke nearly every night of the week. He spends at least four hours a day singing to himself in the car, in the shower, at his desk and anywhere else he can. Use a karaoke app on your phone to practice. Hamilton keeps a list of go-to songs on his phone divided into different categories, including up-tempo, ballads and duets. His favorite is Alexandra Burke’s version of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah.” For karaoke, you don’t need to have all the lyrics memorized, but it helps to have practiced a song until you can sing it confidently. Given the choice, Hamilton avoids private karaoke rooms, opting instead for the bar-style public ones where your audience includes strangers. If you’re shy or planning to sing something new, alcohol can sometimes ease nerves. Don’t overdo it, and choose a room-temperature drink. “Cold beverages aren’t good for your throat,” Hamilton says. You don’t have to be a great vocalist, but your skill level should be a consideration when choosing what to sing. An upbeat party song that prompts a singalong can be a good option for so-so singers who might struggle to carry a song alone.",How to Choose a Karaoke Song,2022-06-28T09:00:07+0000,article,Magazine,News,"Music;Karaoke;Carey, Mariah"

Now, 30 years later, their friendship rumpled but still fundamentally intact, the three — all mothers, all in variegatedly troublesome marriages — converge for the wedding of Funmi’s daughter in Lagos. This is the Destiny of the title, an aloof and reluctant bride (“Happiness is for Americans, that’s what Daddy always says”) who lends the plot the modest drama of will-she-or-won’t-she as her big day approaches, all while Funmi steams ahead with ostentatious celebrations.","Over Decades, Three Friends Learn the Value of Selfishness",2022-06-28T09:00:07+0000,article,Books,Review,"Books and Literature;Obaro, Tomi"

In their writing and artwork — and also at the glossy tech conferences where they often speak — Bridle holds forth a dark vision of where big tech has actually led us, for all its utopian claims. In their first book, “New Dark Age: Technology and the End of the Future,” Bridle depicted a world smothering under dark clouds both literal and figurative, a planet whose ecological and structural collapse cannot even be grasped by its people, obscured as it is in a fog of impenetrable complexity. In Bridle’s view, world culture is currently locked in a vicious and deadly cycle, endlessly insisting “on the power of images and computation to rectify a situation that is produced by our unquestioning belief in their authority.” It’s suicide by data, on a global scale.",The Disrupter’s Disrupter Tells Us to Ignore Our Instincts,2022-06-28T09:00:19+0000,article,Books,Review,"Animal Cognition;Books and Literature;Artificial Intelligence;Animal Behavior;Sustainable Living;Bridle, James"
