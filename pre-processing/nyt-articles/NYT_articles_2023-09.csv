Intrigue ensues, and the shock of two gay cowboys gives way to what we might expect from a classic western: shootouts, horseback chases, fugitive justice. Almodóvar’s second film in English forgoes the melodrama for which he is best known, adhering instead to genre traditions, so “the interrupted and then resumed love story between these two men will be taken more seriously,” the 73-year-old Spanish director says.","Out West, the Gay Cowboy Roams Free",2023-09-05T09:00:39+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Homosexuality and Bisexuality;Cowboys and Cowgirls;Men and Boys;Art;Asian-Americans;yi Hou, Oscar;Esparza, Rafa (1981- );Joseph, Kahlil (1981- );ALMODOVAR, PEDRO;Tam, Kenneth (1982- )"

Suicides increased as well. As with many economic calamities, adolescents and young adults were especially impacted, having to support themselves on low wages that were hard to come by.

1328,Seeing works by Sophocles and Aeschylus in their native land imparts indelible lessons about pain and memory.,"Sometimes, art precedes life. The word “landscape,” for instance, originally meant a painting, and only later also the land itself. In a similar way, “tragedy” originated onstage, as a dramatic form, before acquiring the more general meaning of a devastating or unfortunate situation. What we now think of as Greek tragedy is a relatively small corpus from the fifth century B.C., fewer than three dozen plays from the hundreds that were produced over the course of that century. Among the tragedians, there are extant works from only three: Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides. Their plays premiered at the annual City Dionysia, a festival that was held on the slopes of the Acropolis each spring, drawing large audiences. Some of the features of those premieres might seem strange to us now: Each dramatist presented four plays at a time, in competition; the performances took place outdoors in daylight; the actors wore masks of fixed expression; and, with the exception of the chorus, the roles in any given play were performed by no more than three actors, all male. Theatrical conventions have changed since then. But the plays still reach us with their clarity, nobility and wisdom. When I flew to Athens last summer, it was to fulfill a dream of seeing Greek tragedy performed in Greece. I hoped to come closer to the strange power of these works.",What Ancient Greek Tragedies Can Teach Us About Grief,2023-09-12T09:01:56+0000,article,Magazine,News,Grief (Emotion);Greece;Theater;Illegal Immigration;Greek Civilization;Archaeology and Anthropology;Museums;National Archaeological Museum (Athens)

Back when the U.S. immigration policy resembled a revolving door more than a steel wall, tens of thousands of families would travel north to harvest seasonal crops. For his parents, the work was in service of a long-held dream: to build a house in their native Michoacán. The children were frequently uprooted and placed in new schools as the family zigzagged across the state, following the work. It wasn’t until a teacher, Ms. Young (Michelle Krusiec), intervened that the Hernández parents settled in Stockton, Calif., forsaking their dream for their children’s education.

1666,"Plus: a renovated Parisian dining institution, an ode to the art of folding — and more recommendations from T Magazine.","Seen from Paris’s Pont de la Tournelle, the eight-story facade of the landmark restaurant La Tour d’Argent looks about the same as it did when its third-generation owner André Terrail grew up there in the 1980s, deploying toy parachutists into quayside traffic. But the interior is no longer indifferent to the 21st century: Late last month, La Tour d’Argent reopened its doors after a yearlong renovation led by the Paris-based architect Franklin Azzi. “It’s my Tour,” says Terrail, who took over following his father’s death in 2006. “The same, but more exacting, more thoughtful.” The new look draws on the outsize history of the classically French fine-dining institution, which has been serving diners since 1582, taking particular inspiration from the streamlined motifs of its Art Deco era. On the seventh floor, the redesigned restaurant — overseen since 2020 by executive chef Yannick Franques — functions more than ever as a theater. The airy dining room, in shades of indigo and silver, looks onto an open-plan kitchen and an elevated platform where the restaurant’s signature pressed-duck dish is prepared nightly. Upstairs and downstairs are new bars suited to less formal occasions: Le Bar des Maillets d’Argent, an all-day lounge with a fireplace, and Le Toit de la Tour, a rooftop terrace. Given that it has the welcoming air of a boutique hotel, it’s no wonder that the building can now host overnight visitors in a private apartment on the fifth floor, complete with a touch of Scandinavian-style minimalism attributable, in part, to Terrail’s Finnish mother. tourdargent.com.",An Exhibition of U.F.O.

1807,Modern artisans are transforming the centuries-old cheap but elegant method of reusing offcuts.,"For the Queens-based duo Raphael Martinez Cohen, 34, and Ryan Bush, 32, terrazzo is a way to repurpose the detritus of daily life. The two artists founded their joint sculptural practice, Ficus Interfaith, nine years ago.

Martinez Cohen and Bush combine their unconventional rock substitutes with colored cement or epoxy, forming a slurry that they pour into zinc and brass outlines to create kitschy, expressionistic tableaus. The results suggest Roman mosaics by way of Brooklyn: “Date Palm Tree (Tree of Paradise)” (2018), a 6-by-2-foot composition in a pine frame, depicts a palm tree with a wiggly trunk and faux-naïve fronds from which hang fruits inlaid with sections of real date pits.",The Make-Do Joys of Terrazzo,2023-09-15T09:00:50+0000,article,T Magazine,News,Handicrafts;Design;Rock and Stone;Ceramics and Pottery;Art

In 2022, the second of two originals — inspired by a childhood adventure of sneaking into a famed dance hall to watch couples drag and sway to the live performances of Clyde McPhatter or Duke Ellington — came up for auction at Christie’s, selling for $15.3 million. The buyer was the Houston-based energy trader and high-stakes gambler Bill Perkins, 54, who won a bidding war against 22 other prospects. This vast divergence of price belies a convergence of spirit: The countless individuals hanging inexpensive prints on the walls of bedrooms and barbershops share with Perkins (and no doubt with the other wealthy collectors who bid the painting up to more than 76 times its high estimate) an ineluctable desire for the nostalgia and affirmation that Barnes’s work conveys.","Millions Saw His Paintings on TV.

Both doors open onto long, dark hallways; one runs through the east wing, the other through the west wing. Take a few steps down either hallway, turn south and you’re suddenly standing in a cavernous 1,800-square-foot space: part living room, part dining room and kitchen, all sheathed in Kebony. In place of a back wall, there are 115 feet of sliding glass doors, angled to appear like a massive bay window. On a sunny day, it can take a few seconds for your eyes to adjust to both the light and the expansive view of wildflower fields, grasses, holm oak trees and olive groves.","In This Vacation Home, the Art Is the View",2023-09-18T09:01:26+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Real Estate and Housing (Residential);Travel and Vacations;Interior Design and Furnishings;Alentejo (Portugal);Penot, Fabrice"

So many times she’s listened to the waiters sing those bars, on her birthday and her brother’s, year after year, every milestone celebrated in that fantastical dining room tricked out with fake trees. Back then, the address was just outside of Chinatown, which emerged in the 1870s within the predominantly Irish and later Italian Five Points slum, at the bracket of Bayard, Mott and Pell Streets. The New York Times first mentions the neighborhood by name in 1880, coolly noting that a few property owners in the area refused to take Chinese tenants, while others demanded rents “considerably above those paid by Christians.” These days, depending on whom you ask, the neighborhood sprawls from Delancey Street down to Chambers Street, west to Broadway and east as far as the river.","Saving Chinatown, While Also Making It Their Own",2023-09-19T09:01:05+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Chinese-Americans;Asian-Americans;Youth;Small Business;Restaurants;Chinese Food (Cuisine);Art;Chinatown (Manhattan, NY);New York City;Liang, Sandy;Lum, Mei (1990- )"

The summer that just blazed by belonged unequivocally to the girls and girlies, cultural archetypes who embodied, in their despondency and their delight, the incongruities of being young and female in America. Unlike the always-hustling girlboss, the girlies do not dream of labor. They pick at “girl dinners,” go on “hot-girl walks” or rot in bed with Sylvia Plath and Ottessa Moshfegh paperbacks.

Markus Glocker, 42, of New York’s Koloman, likewise set out to create a lighter take on the original. “You’re not going to feel like you just ate a stone,” he says of his salmon en croûte, in which slices of tramezzini, a fluffy Italian bread, are wrapped around a rare salmon filet slicked with scallop-and-parsley mousse and topped with gherkins and a beet-infused butter. At Melbourne, Australia’s Aru, the pâté en croûte is reminiscent of a fancy bánh mì. Chả lua, a ground Vietnamese pork loaf, is combined with chicken liver pâté for the filling, and the jelly layer between the meat and the pastry is seasoned with rice vinegar, soy sauce and Maggi, an MSG-spiked seasoning. “It’s quite a humbling experience,” says the charcutier George Jephson, 39, of assembling his iteration, which is stuffed with pork belly, confit pork tongue, crisped chicken skin, pistachios and port jelly, and can be found at his East London wine bar, Cadet, and at nearby restaurants, including Chiltern Firehouse. Still, making use of the whole pig, he says, is worth the effort. “I worked 10 years as a butcher, and we didn’t sell a single piece of pork liver,” he says. “Now I sell 60 kilos a week.” — Lauren Joseph",Luxurious Takes on Pâté en Croûte,2023-09-19T11:00:15+0000,article,T Magazine,News,Cooking and Cookbooks;Pate (Food);Jewels and Jewelry;Furniture;Fashion and Apparel;Watches and Clocks

2567,"Plus: Mohammed Sami’s paintings of displacement, a new omakase spot — and more recommendations from T Magazine.","An unusual nigiri will soon be on offer at Bar Miller, a new omakase restaurant in New York City’s East Village: the humble bluefish, sourced from the New York-New Jersey coast, served raw. “Bluefish has this reputation as being a lesser tier, like a poor man’s fish. But if you treat it with care, it’s incredible,” says Jeff Miller, the executive chef. “When it’s in season, it’s rich, fatty and buttery, with a little bit of subtle tuna iron quality.” Featuring bluefish on a sushi menu is surprising when the city is awash with omakase that, like those in Tokyo, offer prestigious (but unsustainable, according to Seafood Watch) fish like bluefin tuna, Japanese yellowtail and Japanese eel. “Sometimes I think my life would be so much easier If I’d gone that route,” Miller says in reference to the classic omakase menu for which there are standard suppliers. Instead, through trial and error, he built a menu entirely from domestic fish. Bar Miller, which is set to open on Sept. 27, serves San Franciscan anchovies, Hudson Valley eel head trout, and Long Island porgy. (The latter, Miller says, tastes sweet and “super subtle [with] a deep oceanic flavor.”) Miller’s attention to local delicacies extends beyond marine life: The restaurant’s sushi rice is farmed in the Hudson Valley; its sushi vinegar is fermented in Pennsylvania; its soy sauce comes from Connecticut. Even its sake is hyperlocal, fermented in Sunset Park and Bushwick. For Miller, sourcing locally is about expanding on his lifelong appreciation of Japanese cuisine; sustainability is an attendant benefit. barmiller.com.","At This Vending Machine, Four Quarters Get You One Surprise Artwork",2023-09-21T13:00:13+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Vending Machines;Big Night (Manhattan, NY, Retailer);Sami, Mohammed (1984- );Hotels and Travel Lodgings;Art;Restaurants;Carter, Micaiah"

Combining a traditional Mexican aesthetic and materials with a Japanese-influenced perspective — Valtierra lived and studied in Kyoto and counts the writings of Soetsu Yanagi, the founder of the Mingei folk-art movement, as a prime source of inspiration — her pieces are known for their undulating accents and understated palettes. Improbably delicate loops of ribboned clay trace the edges of vases; graceful, swooping scallops circle the rims of plates and bowls. To García Bernal, the sinuous shapes conjure the spiraling plumes of the steam trains he was fascinated by as a child visiting relatives in northwestern Mexico. “What touches me most is not when I discover something but instead recognize it,” he says. “That’s what happened when I saw her work: I was very eager to meet her.”",Gael García Bernal and Perla Valtierra on Making Work That Lasts,2023-09-22T09:01:06+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Actors and Actresses;Ceramics and Pottery;Content Type: Personal Profile;Garcia Bernal, Gael;Valtierra, Perla;Mexico"

2997,T’s 2023 Art issue looks at a New York subculture that has been a fixture of the city’s history — and highly influential on its development over the last century.,"Commercial galleries are an old business, and a unique one within the New York City economy, something between a storefront and a salon, the anchor of both a largely unregulated marketplace and of creative expression itself. The earliest examples of galleries in New York, from the first half of the 19th century, predate every major museum and auction house in the metropolitan area, not to mention Central Park, the Brooklyn Bridge, the Empire State Building and Grand Central Terminal. This would seem to suggest there is something indelible about galleries in the landscape of this city and, by extension, any truly global city that values culture. That New York has the largest network of galleries in the world is a fact that many observers of the art business simply take for granted: Why does New York have so many galleries? Because it’s the center of the art world. Why is New York the center of the art world?

I, for one, submit that Black history will always hover over American literature, whether or not the author intends it to. As Toni Morrison wrote in 1992, the Black American population “preceded every American writer of renown and was, I have come to believe, one of the most furtively radical impinging forces on the country’s literature.”","In Her Fiction, Ayana Mathis Refuses to Ignore Black History",2023-09-25T09:00:10+0000,article,Books,Review,"Books and Literature;Mathis, Ayana;The Unsettled: A Novel (Book)"

3064,"JJ Johnson writes a book on the art of rice, Li-Lac celebrates a century of making chocolate and more food news.","Dassai, the brand of sake made by Asahi Shuzo in Yamaguchi, in southern Japan, is not new to the United States. But this week its sake produced in the Hudson Valley is making its debut. On Oct. 12, the company’s new sake brewery in Hyde Park, N.Y., a 55,000 square foot complex of rooms for washing and soaking rice, koji-making, drying, steaming, fermenting and bottling, will open its visitor center for tastings and tours by reservation, $50. The facility is producing a few sakes, the first of which, Dassai Blue 50, is now appearing on store shelves and in restaurants. Kazuhiro Sakurai, the company’s president, said that Dassai has partnered with the nearby Culinary Institute of America, which approached them to open the brewery in part to work with its instructors, students and chefs to educate them about sake. Dassai is a supporter of the cooking school. In addition to the brewery’s sprawl of antiseptic white rooms equipped to handle the various stages of sake-making, there is a separate building where the rice for sake is milled at enough of a distance to prevent dust from the process from tainting production. Rice is milled or polished to varying degrees — the more extreme the finer the drink. Dassai Blue 50 refers to the rice grains that are polished to 50 percent of their original size, making the drink a daiginjo. (The company plans to introduce sakes at 35 percent and a 23 percent.) For now the rice is being imported from Japan, but Dassai has begun cultivating the proper variety in Arkansas. Dassai Blue 50 (about $35) is clear, with a fruity, honeydew aroma, and a smooth, slightly sweet flavor. Though most sakes, including Dassai’s imports, have 16 to 17 percent alcohol, Dassai Blue 50 is 14 percent. Mr. Sakurai’s father, Hiroshi Sakurai, the company chairman, said that one of their goals is to make sake more acceptable to accompany cuisines other than Japanese; “a challenge,” he said. The company recommends using stemware, not traditional sake glasses.",Dassai Opens Its Sprawling Sake Brewery in the Hudson Valley,2023-09-25T19:05:21+0000,article,Food,News,Food;Shopping and Retail;Sake;Petrossian;Chocolate;Books and Literature

The live shows helped establish the Williamsburg alt scene of the early aughts (bands like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs had some of their first New York performances at Mighty Robot).

Barely in her 30s, the self-destructive single mother is throwing away her future with an assist from her feckless ex, Ian (Jack Reynor, sputtering and hilarious), and their 14-year-old son, Max (Oren Kinlan), a thief and would-be rapper. It’s a testament to Hewson’s extraordinary charisma that her character can openly wish Max would get kidnapped and we root for her anyway. But since she’s saddled with the boy, Flora foists a junked guitar on him as a birthday present. “It’s a piano,” she jokes.

3478,"Plus: a new seasonal restaurant in Brooklyn, a Marisol retrospective — and more recommendations from T Magazine.","The Danish chef Mads Refslund first began working on Ilis, his new restaurant in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, in 2016. After years of high-profile jobs at places like Manhattan’s Acme and Shou Sugi Ban House in the Hamptons, Refslund, a co-founder of Noma, wanted a permanent space where he could create an immersive culinary experience. The open kitchen, and its live fire grill, is at the center of the 4,800-square foot room on Green Street. The space has 17-foot ceilings with wooden beams and exposed brick walls; custom rosewood tables and leather banquettes frame the perimeter (though a few counter seats provide the best vantage of a meal coming together). “This is about transparency,” Refslund says. The name Ilis is a portmanteau of sorts, with ild meaning “fire” in Danish and is meaning “ice.” It’s a nod to the dichotomous spirit of the restaurant — serious cooking with laid-back dinner party vibes. The menu allows guests to choose from a selection of primary ingredients, say New England scallops or Pennsylvania wild duck, and, in some cases, style of preparation (raw or grilled, for example). The seasonal cuisine is informed by Refslund’s Scandinavian upbringing, as well as his travels to Japan and Mexico City. But, the chef says, “hopefully, it will just become a New York restaurant,” a reflection of the city he now calls home.
