10,A new series tells a coming-of-age story based loosely on the life of Emily Dickinson. And an adaptation of a recent Broadway play hits Netflix.,"DICKINSON Stream on Apple TV Plus. Emily Dickinson is imbued with teenage angst and a vocabulary that includes words like “dude” and “sick” in this series debuting Friday as one of the first shows on Apple’s new streaming service. “Dickinson,” which stars Hailee Steinfeld as a version of the 19th-century poet, reimagines Dickinson as a patriarchy-fighting millennial who throws ragers, relentlessly pursues her creative impulses and hangs out with a personification of death played by the rapper Wiz Khalifa. She also rebels against her overbearing father and has a romance with her future sister-in-law. In a recent interview with The New York Times, the show’s creator, Alena Smith, described “Dickinson” as “a coming-of-age story about a radical young female artist who was ahead of her time.” The tone calls to mind teen dramas like “Riverdale.” Part of the idea, Smith said, is to consider Dickinson through a modern lens. “If she wasn’t that well understood in her time,” Smith asked, “can we understand her better in ours?”",What’s on TV Friday: ‘Dickinson’ and ‘American Son’,2019-11-01T05:00:07+0000,article,Arts,News,Television;Movies

Their mistake was to award the magazine’s literary prize to a story about a murderous Uruguayan police inspector; when it was published, several staff members were summarily imprisoned. For six weeks Onetti languished in a mental institution. It took a campaign led by international writers — including Onetti’s admirers Gabriel García Márquez and Mario Vargas Llosa — to persuade his jailers to set him free.

770,Cecelia Condit’s unsettling 1983 work “Possibly in Michigan” has found a home among Generation Z.,"ONE RECENT WEEKDAY, I was sitting with the video artist and retired professor Cecelia Condit in the dining room of her fairly nondescript apartment in the upper-middle-class Milwaukee suburb of Shorewood, Wis. The space also doubles as Condit’s studio, but other than a laptop and a few hard drives, scant evidence of a working artist could be found. Over grapes and pudding, we watched my iPhone, which was spitting out audio from “Possibly in Michigan,” Condit’s brutal, surreal and darkly funny 1983 art musical that is in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art. Shot using then nascent video technology and set to an eerily chipper Casio-fueled soundtrack provided by Karen Skladany, who also acted in the film, the 12-minute “Possibly in Michigan” follows a masked cannibal named Arthur — played by, at different points, Condit and the actors Bill Blume and Stephen Vogel — as he stalks Jill Sands (playing a character named Sharon) and Skladany (as Sharon’s friend Janice) through a nondescript Middle American shopping mall. (Despite its name, the video was filmed in Cleveland, where Condit was living at the time.) The cannibal follows the women home, at which point he’s murdered and then eaten himself. The film ends with the body being disposed in a couple of trash bags and picked up by a local garbage collector.",How This 71-Year-Old Video Art Pioneer Became a TikTok Star,2019-11-06T14:00:13+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Art;Video Recordings, Downloads and Streaming;Social Media;TikTok (ByteDance);Condit, Cecelia"

To study the effectiveness of international rules against anonymous, untraceable shell companies, Sharman and two other researchers impersonated 21 different fictitious consultants and sent 7,400 emails to 3,700 so-called corporate service providers (often law or accounting firms) in 182 countries, asking for help setting one up. Nearly half the respondents failed to comply with regulations requiring the collection of identity documents. The conclusion: It is more than three times as hard to put an untraceable shell company in an offshore tax haven than in a developed country. For anonymity, set up your company in Nevada, Delaware or Wyoming; it can be done in 10 to 40 minutes, and for as little as $200.",How to Set Up a Shell Company,2019-11-07T10:00:03+0000,article,Magazine,News,Tax Shelters

Fuming and raging, lashing out at his familiars, he is a chain-smoking wild beast being kept in cultural captivity. His growing fame brings admirers to his freezing workshop, where they wonder at his ascetic indifference to discomfort, and still more — gifted as he surely is — at his capacity for self-criticism. Not that his manhood can be in any doubt: He flaunts his ravishing young mistress before his careworn, miserable wife, who nonetheless remains his devoted slave in the fervent belief that she is the one who truly understands him. In one scene, in a fit of furious dissatisfaction, he hurls a sheaf of sketches into a flaming brazier before a group of astonished onlookers. The camera shows the horror on their faces as they watch the artworks burn, a horror it is assumed we share.

The film focuses on the toll that the policy took during its decades of enforcement (China embraced the policy in the late 1970s and ended it in 2015). It uses Wang’s own family and story as a way in, combining her narration with interviews with people who felt the effects of the policy in different, troubling ways. It’s an emotionally intense topic that Wang and Zhang address “with clarity, concision and strategically restrained outrage,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. “I’ve watched ‘One Child Nation’ twice, at times through tears,” she added, “but there’s nothing in it that’s gratuitously exploitative. It is instead an essential account of one battle in the continuing war over women’s bodies, one that, Wang forcefully observes, is in no way limited to China.”",What’s on TV Friday: ‘One Child Nation’ and ‘Great Performances’,2019-11-08T06:00:11+0000,article,Arts,News,Television;Movies

1182,"T’s roundup of people, places and things to know now.","Virgil Abloh, the artistic director of Louis Vuitton’s men’s wear, is nothing if not intellectually nimble. He trained as an architect and has worked as a D.J., artist, musician and Kanye West whisperer. When it comes to fashion, his references are equally wide-ranging, and he’s proved as likely to send trench coats and pleated pants down the runway as mesh tees and floral harnesses. With his latest capsule collection, he’s baked versatility into individual pieces. Included in the 14-item line, called Louis Vuitton 2054 (the year the brand will turn 200), is a shirt that turns into a pillow, a weekend bag that morphs into a sleeping bag and a coat that doubles as a backpack. It was, according to Abloh, an exercise in rethinking the nature of apparel and what the future of fashion will be. He arrived at his answer — technical and transformable — after looking at collapsible camping equipment. “I was very much inspired by the materials and folding ingenuity that exists in that world of products,” Abloh said, in comments emailed by the brand.

Even before going solo in 1989, Byrne’s side projects tentacled into disparate worlds: He collaborated with similarly polymathic artists such as Brian Eno, Robert Wilson and Twyla Tharp; he starred in the writer-director Jonathan Demme’s 1984 documentary “Stop Making Sense”; and two years later, he directed the Robert Altman-on-acid jukebox art film “True Stories.” In the ’90s and beyond, Byrne used his fame to advance and collaborate with a wide range of artists — the world-music acts on his label, Luaka Bop; the D.J. Fatboy Slim on “Here Lies Love,” their 2013 musical about Imelda Marcos; the singer St. Vincent on their joint 2012 album “Love This Giant.” His latest act of radical pop is “American Utopia,” an album and touring rock show (which debuted in 2018) that wears its theme lightly but seriously reimagines space: Mobile musicians hop across a bare stage, dancing to their own music.

It was while digging near the Roman amphitheater in Klima, in 1820, that the amateur archaeologist Olivier Voutier discovered the marble statue known as the “Venus de Milo.” The celebrated work now lives at the Louvre in Paris, but Milos’s mystique remains intact. Thanks to its serene fishing villages, secluded caves, innumerable swimming beaches (many accessible only by boat) and an abundance of locally run restaurants offering fresh catch and regional Greek wines, this tranquil island is quickly gaining appeal for travelers who want Aegean charm without the crowds.","A Guide to Milos, a Greek Island With Fewer Crowds and More Beaches",2019-11-14T18:19:25+0000,article,T Magazine,News,Greece;Cyclades Islands;Travel and Vacations;Hotels and Travel Lodgings;Restaurants;Swimming;Coastal Areas;AEGEAN SEA

The abrupt drop in temperatures across the Eastern United States this week may make this animated Santa origin story uncomfortably relatable, as it is set on an island above the Arctic Circle.

It is the first feature directed by Sergio Pablos, an animator and screenwriter whose decades-long history working with Disney informs this movie’s look. “It all moves along so amiably, and offers such consistently delightful visuals, that the conventional plot points, up to and including an inevitable ‘but I can explain’ bit, are entirely digestible,” Glenn Kenny wrote in his review for The New York Times. “These clichés inhibit ‘Klaus’ from achieving instant-classic status, but the film is winning enough that it’s worth a place in a family Christmas-movie library (not that, as a Netflix offering, it will take up any physical space).”",What’s on TV Friday: Santa Claus and Sonny Liston,2019-11-15T06:00:06+0000,article,Arts,News,Television;Movies

2747,Unraveling the mysteries of sleep might depend on studying the genes of people who don’t get much.,"We humans spend a third of our lives asleep, oblivious to our surroundings and temporarily paralyzed. It’s a vulnerability that would seem to diminish our odds of survival, so evolutionarily speaking it must also somehow confer tremendous benefits. Yet our best guesses about what those benefits are tend to come from observing what happens when sleep is curtailed. As far as we know, all animals sleep in some way; deprive most of them of it for long enough, and they will die, but exactly why is unclear. In 2015, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep Research Society published a joint statement, based on a comprehensive review of research, saying that “sleeping less than seven hours per night on a regular basis” — which is the case for an estimated 35 to 40 percent of Americans during the workweek — is associated with adverse health outcomes. These include weight gain and obesity, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease and stroke, depression, impaired immune function, increased pain, greater likelihood of accidents and “increased risk of death.” The National Institutes of Health reported last year that sleep deficits may increase the beta-amyloid proteins in the brain linked with Alzheimer’s disease. But when it comes to “what sleep is, how much you need and what it’s for,” says Louis Ptacek, a professor of neurology at the University of California, San Francisco, “we know almost nothing — other than it’s bad not to get enough of it.” Indeed, says David Dinges, one of the statement’s authors and a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, “All of this makes it really tough to send out simple messages to the public about when you should sleep and how much you should sleep.”",Will Science Ever Give Us a Better Night’s Sleep?,2019-11-19T10:00:03+0000,article,Magazine,News,"Sleep;Genetics and Heredity;Research;Brain;Ptacek, Louis;Fu, Ying-Hui"

2875,"Ahead of a new solo show, Suzanne Jackson talks about her creative routine, her love of jazz music and the worst studio she ever had.","Suzanne Jackson isn’t fond of the term “overachiever,” though you wouldn’t be wrong to call her one. At 75, she has had a long, storied, multi-hyphenate career as a painter, poet, dancer, teacher, curator and theater designer. She’s not a fan of the word “career” either: “It’s my life’s work,” she says. “There’s just a lot of things to be interested in.” Jackson traces that attitude back to her childhood in 1940s and ’50s pre-statehood Alaska, where a certain pioneering spirit prevailed. “We just did things,” she remembers. She went to college at San Francisco State University at 17, studying art, drama and dance; toured South America as a ballerina; and in 1967, moved to Los Angeles, where she tooled around town in a Buick Hearse, took drawing classes from Charles White, began showing her paintings at the influential Ankrum gallery and, in 1968, opened Gallery 32, the community-minded space she ran out of her studio near MacArthur Park for two years. There, she hosted exhibitions by emerging black artists like David Hammons and Betye Saar, as well as a fund-raiser for the Black Panthers. As a single mother in her 40s with her son in tow, she earned a graduate degree in theater design at Yale, worked on productions with the Kennedy Center and the Berkeley Repertory Theater and eventually settled in Georgia in the mid-90s to teach at the Savannah College of Art and Design.

Amid the giddiness of the post-World War I period, when women began to assert themselves more at social events and Prohibition made booze alluringly naughty, dimly lit get-togethers became fashionable. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the era also saw the birth of cocktail jewelry: massive gems, both precious and semiprecious, in rings and pendants, made to be brazenly visible even in low light. By the 1940s, Tiffany & Co. was known for such oversize pieces, especially with aquamarine surrounded by diamonds. The ice-blue mineral, which, like emerald, is part of the beryl family, gets its color from traces of iron; it is among the hardest stones, resulting in larger, flawlessly clear crystal formations. This new pendant, with a 43-carat cushion-cut aquamarine dangling from a 21-inch rope of diamond rondels, is impossible to miss — glinting audaciously even in starlight or the first blush of dawn. 2019 Tiffany Blue Book Collection, price on request, (800) 518-5555.",A Cocktail Necklace That Demands Attention,2019-11-25T16:00:07+0000,article,T Magazine,News,Parties (Social);Tiffany & Company;Jewels and Jewelry

And now it’s coming to Broadway.,"The Alanis Morissette song “Hand in My Pocket” is a list of opposites that aren’t really opposites at all, when you really think about it. “I’m short but I’m healthy,” she sings, in the half-yodel, half-dove-coo that people still channel in late-night karaoke bars. “I’m sick but I’m pretty, babyyyy.” Being petite has no bearing on a person’s hardiness, but of course, that isn’t the point. Morissette wrote the song — which became the fourth track on “Jagged Little Pill,” an album so popular at its height that it sold nearly half a million copies in one week — in less than an hour when she was 20. The lyrics are more affective than logical, more moody than meticulous. Morissette was showing that young people contain multitudes and that they are eager to describe — to themselves, to some distant, judgmental grown-up — their contradictory inner lives.",Alanis Morissette Isn’t Angry Anymore.

As we all sat on the terrace that warm July morning, enjoying our usual holiday breakfast of fresh croissants and jam, I barely stopped to think how this wonderful man at the head of the table had lived through more than we could imagine. Born in 1919, Jean-Jacques Cartier had—like so many of his remarkable generation—witnessed cataclysmic world events firsthand. He’d seen the devastating lows of the Depression and fought in the Second World War. He had experienced more years of the Roaring Twenties than of the twenty-first century. And yet, that day, watching him open his birthday cards, he was simply Grandpa, with his neatly combed white hair and mustache and smiling blue eyes. But all that was about to change. I was just moments away from making a discovery that would bring me face-to-face with not only his past but the lives of many of my ancestors.","‘The Cartiers: The Untold Story Behind the Jewelry Empire,’ by Francesca Cartier Brickell: An Excerpt",2019-11-26T10:01:00+0000,article,Books,Review,

Especially the factory, where gigantic presses could smash his hands and crush them, make nubs of his fingers. The machines crashed and pounded, and the huge wheels at the tops of the presses turned, and Tiny slid his little piece of metal under the die and hooked both hands on the buttons, and the presses turned over and came down with unbelievable force and stamped out one part at a time. He hooked the part with a little rubber suction cup on a rod, drew it safely out of the way, and inserted another piece, inhaling the exhaust of the Towmotors while standing on a skid to raise himself up to the level where other men stood.","‘Tiny Love: The Complete Stories,’ by Larry Brown: An Excerpt",2019-11-26T10:01:00+0000,article,Books,Review,

Conceived by the house’s then artistic director, Jacques Helleu, the design was cast in matte monochromatic ceramic, a material that gave the women’s accessory a fresh, graphic athleticism. “There was such authority to the design that you either loved it or hated it, but you could not be indifferent,” recalls Arnaud Chastaingt, who became the director of the Chanel Watch Creation Studio in 2013, following a 10-year tenure as a designer at Cartier. “The best creations work that way. That’s a sign of success for me.” Available first in jet black, and later in white, the J12 combines the functionality of a sports watch with the elegance of a link bracelet style. It proved wildly popular and has since joined the N°5 fragrance and the 2.55 handbag as one of Chanel’s most iconic creations.",It Takes Two Months to Make This Classic Chanel Timepiece,2019-11-29T16:00:09+0000,article,T Magazine,News,Watches and Clocks;Chanel SA

Beneath the surface, invisible to the viewer’s eye, are wooden skeletons that give these works their wondrous three-dimensionality, transforming paintings into sculptures that resemble bent elbows, erect nipples and pointed tongues and suggest existential explorations of space. Since the 1950s, Sánchez, who is now 93, has dared to expand the dimensional constraints of painting with boundless ingenuity, conceiving a new visual language for sensuality. But unlike other artists who warped canvases to provocative effect, like the American sculptor Lee Bontecou and the Argentine-Italian painter Lucio Fontana, Sánchez worked for decades in obscurity.",An Artist Who Transforms Paintings Into Cosmic Sculptures,2019-11-29T16:05:36+0000,article,T Magazine,News,Art;Hurricane Maria (2017);Sculpture;El Museo del Barrio
