146,"In Tembe Denton-Hurst’s new novel, “Homebodies,” a young woman loses her New York media job and must figure out how to restart her life.","In her sharp, charming and passionate debut, “Homebodies,” Tembe Denton-Hurst showcases an eye for the details that matter. Fashion girls are “Midwest Christian-types born-again in fuzzy pink cardigans and Dries boots.” A girlfriend’s painstaking domestic labors are described with equal parts unease and grateful relief. The impatient lunch-break Slack ping from a peevish white boss perfectly sets up the doom of the meeting that follows. It is this eye for the rhythms and textures of life — of millennial digital media, of the death by a thousand cuts offered by workplace racism, of Maryland suburbia — that makes this novel vivid and inviting. “Homebodies” is the story of a young Black woman’s quarter-life crisis as she wonders what her place in the world will be.","A Black, Queer Hero’s Journey for the Digital Age",2023-05-02T09:00:17+0000,article,Books,Review,"Books and Literature;Denton-Hurst, Tembe"

Scott Fitzgerald’s observation that “France has the only two things toward which we drift as we grow older — intelligence and good manners,” we packed up our possessions during the last dark days of one December and decided to move to Paris. It was pleasant, I had often been told, for a writer to live somewhere where reading and writing were accorded the highest respect, and it was true that — in Paris at least — these were semipublic activities: In every park and cafe, on the Metro and on the benches along the Seine, people were openly engaged in what for me had always been the most private and solitary of occupations. Bookstores still held their ground here among the shopfronts, and the deification of French writers living and dead was evinced everywhere in street names and statues and advertising hoardings for new novels.

It’s a live-action/computer-generated hybrid that brings in characters from the worlds of Lego, “Peter Pan,” “Sonic the Hedgehog” and more. The hodgepodge style gives children a crash course in how animation has evolved over the years — but they probably won’t realize that. They’ll just be entertained by the visuals. The plot revolves around Chip (John Mulaney) and Dale (Samberg), who, after being estranged, reunite in Los Angeles because their old friend Monterey Jack (Eric Bana) has been kidnapped. They team up with a detective (Kiki Layne) to solve the crime. Chip sells insurance and still looks like old-school 2D animation, while Dale has had “C.G.I. surgery” and pines for their glory days. The movie, directed by Schaffer, doesn’t take itself too seriously, so there’s a silliness mixed with some more elevated (as elevated as a Lonely Island collaboration can be) humor meant to appeal to parents. It’s a fun, fast-paced action comedy, with Will Arnett voicing the villain Sweet Pete, a scruffy, potbellied Peter Pan who looks like he’s seen better days.",Five Children’s Movies to Stream Now,2023-05-05T11:00:06+0000,article,Movies,News,Movies;Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers (Movie);Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted (Movie);Firedrake: The Silver Dragon (Movie);Chupa (Movie);Earwig and the Witch (Movie)

671,"In her home, the architect Mariana Schmidt combined handmade rural objects with textured and weathered materials to offer a new take on Brazilian minimalism.","GROWING UP BETWEEN Rio de Janeiro and the rural interior of Minas Gerais, a rugged, sprawling state in southeastern Brazil, the architect Mariana Schmidt moved often with her father, an engineer working on the state highway system. Brazil’s second most populous state, Minas Gerais grew during an early 18th-century gold rush that brought in speculators and enslaved people, a forced migration that continued into the next century as agriculture supplanted mining. Though raised in the shadows of Modernism — her grandfather, a Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany, worked in the 1950s on the construction of the exactingly planned Brasília, which would become the national capital in 1960 — Schmidt, 40, was more interested in Minas Gerais’s farmsteads and quilombos, settlements founded by those who escaped slavery before it was abolished in 1888. She loved the warmth of the lime-slaked village houses and the efficiency of the rough-hewn wooden furniture. Life in rural Minas Gerais moved slower than it did in São Paulo, the metropolis where she’s resided since 2005. “The days feel longer. People wake up early, they sleep early, they live according to the light,” she says. “All my references are about that simplicity.”",A São Paulo Apartment Designed With Calculated Flaws,2023-05-05T11:00:11+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"ARCHITECTURE;Interior Design and Furnishings;Bo Bardi, Lina;Sao Paulo (Brazil);Furniture"

The El Bulli Foundation, which replaced his restaurant, is now publishing more than 20 books about many aspects of gastronomy. It’s part of the Bullipedia project, encyclopedic surveys and analyses written by teams of experts. There are eight volumes of intensely‌ detailed books on wine, Bullipedia Wine Sapiens; the first two, “Contextualizaton and Viticulture” and “Vinification and Classifications,” have been translated from Spanish into English — subsidized by Juvé & Camps, a venerable cava producer — and are now available in the United States. “We examined many books on wine, even wine atlases, but found none that took our encyclopedic approach,” Mr. Adrià said. The books are designed for professionals and gastronomes, especially for those who are engaged in and appreciate fine-dining, which Mr. Adrià contends is thriving. With Hubbell precision, the books examine the history, evolution, production, categorization, serving and appreciation of good wine, illustrating the material with close-ups of ripening berries, pruning methods, climate maps, bottling and more in the first two books’ nearly 1,200 pages. Mr. Adrià and Ferran Centelles, the sommelier who covers the beverage side of the project, say they have made discoveries, like the first printed wine list from 1804. It is all, however, seen through a Western lens; the foundation’s definition of fine dining ‌is limited — it does not invite Asian cuisines to the table, for example. “We can only be experts in Western culture,” Mr. Adrià said.",El Bulli’s Explores Gastronomy in an Expansive Series of Books,2023-05-08T16:05:36+0000,article,Food,News,Food;Books and Literature;Chefs;Beverages

The prehistoric sculptor who carved a hunk of mammoth ivory into the “Venus of Hohle Fels” — the earliest known depiction of a human being, unearthed in Germany in 2008 — gave her proportions fit for the pages of Juggs magazine. Since then, male artists have portrayed breasts as erotic objects, fonts of nourishment and sometimes both at once, as in the case of racy Baroque depictions of the Roman virtue Caritas as a young woman nursing her father. Bare-chested women have represented our brightest political ideals (as in the French Romantic painter Eugène Delacroix’s 1830 allegorical work “Liberty Leading the People”) but also our worst transgressions: In medieval European art, lust often appeared as a woman with snakes biting her breasts, an allusion to their supposedly ruinous seductive power. Indeed, these humble mounds of tissue, as the feminist scholar Marilyn Yalom writes in her 1998 book, “A History of the Breast,” have long been the focal points for various desires: “Babies see food. Men see sex. Doctors see disease. Businessmen see dollar signs.”",The Artists Depicting the Power and Strangeness of Breasts,2023-05-16T19:51:33+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Art;Breasts;Women and Girls;Delacroix, Eugene (1798-1863);Kahraman, Hayv (1981- );Modersohn-Becker, Paula (1876-1907);Quarles, Christina (1985- );Saville, Jenny;Semmel, Joan;Valadon, Suzanne"

The poem begins with light and wind — fixtures of poetry. There’s the lyric sweetness of herons and mountains. Even Chaucer’s zephyr shows up. At its midpoint, however, the poem turns. The sorry state of the poet is revealed. The wind won’t blow, or at least not yet. The poem ceases to fly: Instead it’s grounded in the dusty corner. The diction turns, too, from the poetical to the everyday, nearly antipoetical idioms of “crying my eyes out” and “it’s no picnic.” Sadness has done this, extracted the wildness from both the poet and the poet’s vocabulary. Then the kink in the light returns. (This poem was originally commissioned by United States Artists and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and appeared recently in a slightly different form in Shift Space.)

Greg Gianforte of Montana signed a bill banning the app in the state. The legislation seeks to cut off access by targeting mobile app stores, like the Apple Store and Google Play, and prohibit them from offering TikTok in Montana. If the stores continue allowing people to download the app, the companies could face fines, as could TikTok. The ban is set to take effect on Jan. 1, but it is already facing a legal challenge. On Thursday, a group of TikTok users filed a lawsuit contending that the law violated their First Amendment rights and that the ban outstripped Montana’s legal authority as a state.",The Week in Business: An Attempt to Ban TikTok,2023-05-21T11:00:05+0000,article,Business Day,News,"Stocks and Bonds;United States Economy;Social Media;Law and Legislation;Mobile Applications;Politics and Government;Suits and Litigation (Civil);TikTok (ByteDance);Gianforte, Greg (1961- )"

A small band of adventurers had just concluded a 43-day journey from Utah to Nevada — although perhaps “journey” is too tame a description for a trip that had required weeks of small wooden boats tumbling down more than 600 miles of rock-strewn rivers.

There’s good reason for this. The historical and archaeological evidence for her life is scanty, and the record of her deeds lost in the heady accounts of the civil wars that convulsed the entire Mediterranean at the time. Antony and Cleopatra, of course, are familiar figures to us: principal actors in the Roman Republic’s final showdown, the battle of East versus West at Actium in 31 B.C. — even if, in the aftermath of Octavian’s victory, they were portrayed as depraved and doomed lovers who took their own lives.",Cleopatra’s Daughter Led a Life as Eventful as Her Mother’s,2023-05-23T09:00:21+0000,article,Books,Review,"Cleopatra's Daughter: From Roman Prisoner to African Queen (Book);Draycott, Jane;Cleopatra;Egyptian Civilization;Books and Literature;Archaeology and Anthropology;Roman Civilization;Caesar, Julius"

Because they are trying to avoid Pakistani, Iranian and Taliban bad guys who are pursuing them, their lights are off, and Butler’s character is wearing a pair of very stupid-looking infrared goggles. Suddenly there is a sound, one we only learn is a helicopter when those loopy goggles alight on it.

Is it because New York’s intimate sushi counters can’t meet the demand? Whatever the reason, the latest example in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, with 18 seats at a black marble counter facing an impressive open kitchen, follows a playbook that’s as French as it is Japanese. The chef and owner, Yuu Shimano, graduated from the Tsuji Culinary Institute in Osaka, Japan, and Lyon, France. He then worked at Guy Savoy in Paris and moved to New York to become the executive chef at Mifune. Mr. Shimano; his chef de cuisine, Shuji Furukawa; and the pastry chef Masaki Takahashi serve an 18-course tasting menu ($250) starting with a smoked trout tartlet with fennel cream, an octopus fritter, and caviar with sour cream on brioche garnished with a shiso flower. After dishes like smoked mackerel confit, a mushroom flan with surf clam and English peas, and fluke and scallop mousse in cabbage with a vin blanc sauce, the finale is his signature duck pie, like a well-burnished duck Wellington with foie gras. Wine and sake or nonalcoholic pairings are options. The restaurant has a couple of plush lounge areas for after-dinner mignardises and digestifs suggested by Akio Matsumoto, the sommelier. There are seatings at 6 and 8:30 p.m., Tuesdays through Saturdays.","Restaurant Yuu, an Omakase With a French Approach, Opens in Brooklyn",2023-05-23T15:13:35+0000,article,Food,News,"Restaurants;French Food (Cuisine);Japanese Food (Cuisine);New York City;Restaurant Yuu (Brooklyn, NY, Restaurant)"

3162,An elegy to the ecstasy of life in the gutter.,"Jackie Wang’s poem draws its title, in part, from Djuna Barnes’s 1936 novel of queer love, “Nightwood”: “ladies of the haute sewer taking their last stroll, sauntering on their last Rotten Row.” The poem’s rhythm echoes the rhythm of the life the poem describes. Some readers will already know this life. For them — for us — the poem is a recognition, one I don’t often see in contemporary poetry. Poets, however, were once experts on the ecstasy of the gutter. As Francois Villon or Charles Baudelaire did before her, Wang writes poetry that reminds us that life is more than the grim fatalism of to-do lists and bank accounts. The poem rushes forward, headed toward the edge. Then the lover-thieves get caught. The bill comes due. The poem slows. The heart breaks. This was, after all, an elegy. Despite the living thrill of its cadence, “those days,” those lovers, are gone now. What’s left is poetry.

3211,"Plus: a hotel in Portugal that highlights regional artisans, objects from an architectural duo and more recommendations from T Magazine.","When the Danish goldsmith Per Enevoldsen, the co-founder of the jewelry brand Pandora, and his friend Steen Bock first visited Porto, Portugal, they knew they’d eventually return to build something there together. The idea crystallized when they returned in 2016 and discovered a pair of 16th-century buildings in the city’s Largo de São Domingos neighborhood — they’d soon be available but needed work. Now, they’re an integral part of the Largo, the pair’s inaugural hospitality project (opening this week) that combines an 18-room hotel spread across five heritage buildings with the first Porto-based restaurant, Cozinha das Flores, and bar, Flôr, from the Lisbon-born, London-based chef Nuno Mendes. Designed by Space Copenhagen with a focus on local materials and the work of regional artisans — including the Pritzker Prize-winning architect Álvaro Siza, who created a tiled mural for the restaurant — each space reinterprets the look and feel of a Portuguese home. Mendes, who will be cooking dishes such as a sweet prawn and steamed egg cake with presunto balchão (ham in a spicy, vinegary sauce), had long fantasized about pursuing a project in his mother’s homeland. “That, combined with the opportunity to create a street-facing restaurant with rooms above, was particularly exciting,” he says. “Hosting people for a night is great, but if you have 24 hours with them, things get a lot more fun.” The Largo opens May 25, thelargo.com.",A British Fabric Collection That Feels Straight Out of ‘Bridgerton’,2023-05-25T13:00:09+0000,article,T Magazine,News,Textiles;Fashion and Apparel;Hotels and Travel Lodgings;Mah-Jongg (Game);Handicrafts

3392,Five new audiobooks to download this summer include a breakdown of quantum computing and a tribute to Mary Oliver.,"If you’d asked me a month ago what quantum theory was, I would have tried to answer only to stop myself once I realized that I didn’t actually know. It’s one of those concepts, like space-time or artificial intelligence, that many of us recognize (from science fiction, from the news) without ever really understanding them. That’s where QUANTUM SUPREMACY: How the Quantum Computer Revolution Will Change Everything (Random House Audio, 10 hours, 41 minutes), by the renowned translator of theoretical physics Michio Kaku, comes in. Named for the theoretical stage at which “a radically new type of computer, called a quantum computer, could decisively outperform an ordinary digital supercomputer on specific tasks,” the audiobook, read with deliberate — if at times robotic — clarity by Feodor Chin, begins with claims, by a handful of companies, that we are already there.","From Subatomic Particles to the Cosmos, and Every Bird in Between",2023-05-26T15:30:49+0000,article,Books,News,Audiobooks;Birdwatching;Quantum Computing;Physics;internal-sub-only-except-search

The beauty of our current moment is the many new perspectives on old jokes. In the fertile scene of South Asian comedians, Zarna Garg represents something fresh: the revenge of the Indian mom. She’s heard the jokes about the closed-minded Indian parents forcing their children to go to medical school. Now she fires back forcefully, with enough panache to subvert stereotypes even as she’s fully embracing them. Her ethnic and religious humor (she makes a convincing case for Hindu being the most chill religion) is unapologetically old-fashioned: quick setups, rapid-fire punchlines, her name in giant letters on the set behind her.
