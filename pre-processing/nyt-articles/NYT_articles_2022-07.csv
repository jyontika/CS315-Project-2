Almost all the sailors experience a deep unease, “a sense of blasphemy,” at the act of capture: “So close, she was terrifying, a person there, no doubt about it; a trapped and dying woman.” The mermaid, Aycayia — huge, wounded, furious, utterly vulnerable, “crawling with sea-lice” — brings out powerful impulses in the men: to harm, to possess, to touch, to mark her, despite or even because of the hatred in her “tinfoil eyes.” This violent, mesmerizing scene begins “The Mermaid of Black Conch,” signaling the book’s ambition. Monique Roffey’s sixth novel is a fairy tale: The mermaid casts off her tail, regains her legs, falls in love, battles an ancient curse. But it is a ghost story too, the people and the very land of Black Conch haunted by the island’s legacy of colonialism and enslavement.",A Mermaid Makes for a Strange Kind of Immigrant,2022-07-03T09:00:11+0000,article,Books,Review,"Books and Literature;The Mermaid of Black Conch (Book);Roffey, Monique"

654,A longing for and memory of a murdered brother,"The ghazal is a formal poem that has roots in seventh-century Arabia and was often sung by musicians. The poet Agha Shahid Ali introduced the form to America. “Ghazal” literally means “the cry of a gazelle” as it is being chased and about to die. Like many formal poems such as the sonnet, the ghazal, with its restrictions, can paradoxically illuminate and parse difficult emotions. In López’s poem, the emotion is grief — a longing for and memory of a murdered brother. This poem mostly follows the parameters of a ghazal with its repeated end word, “song,” and the inside rhyme of “forever,” “far,” “marred,” etc., as well as the poet’s name or reference to the poet (“Sister”) in the final line. One way this poem breaks the rules is that each couplet doesn’t stand alone as if it were its own poem. Instead, the end of the couplets often bleed into the next stanza, linking the narratives.

(This has always struck me as errant and, frankly, self-serving reasoning.

Shortly after signaling that he was backing out of his deal to buy the social media company, Mr. Musk was sued by Twitter. The company accused him of “knowingly, intentionally, willfully and materially” breaching their agreement. Mr. Musk’s lawyers said on Friday that Twitter’s request in the suit for an expedited trial in September was unreasonable and asked to delay it. When, and if, the case goes to trial, a judge in Delaware’s Court of Chancery will decide whether Mr. Musk’s claims that Twitter withheld information about spam accounts on the site are valid. The two parties could also settle, with Mr. Musk paying damages. Or, if his financing falls through, he could get out of the deal by paying a $1 billion breakup fee. Another possibility still is that Mr. Musk’s threat to walk away spooks Twitter into renegotiating with him, which could result in his buying the company at a discount. Worried shareholders will hear about how much damage Mr. Musk may have done when Twitter releases its second-quarter earnings this week.",The Week in Business: Twitter Hits Back,2022-07-17T11:00:07+0000,article,Business Day,News,"Stocks and Bonds;United States Economy;Science and Technology;Social Media;Twitter;Musk, Elon"

Then we choose. / The little baby points from her / astral cradle.” The speaker marvels at the implications: “I choose that mama. / I choose that daddy. / I choose that irrevocably broken marriage, / That accident that wires my jaw shut, / That burned popcorn” — the litany continues — “That root canal, that unending night on mushrooms, / That dog bite.” “That DUI.” Is it absurd to imagine we select our own pattern of suffering, or that we might have picked a life without any? As Willard Spiegelman notes in his book “Seven Pleasures,” “‘Hap’ means chance.” Happiness and happen share the same root. Whether we choose them or not, the random happenings of our lives, good and bad, are our own. The details that add up to days and years — your street name, your first word, your favorite podcast — have what Ernest Becker might have called a “cosmic specialness.”","Chance, Design and Inevitability in Three New Poetry Books",2022-07-20T09:00:11+0000,article,Books,Review,"Poetry and Poets;The Writing of an Hour (Book);Coultas, Brenda;All the Flowers Kneeling (Book);Tran, Paul (Poet);Human Resources (Book);Stevenson, Ryann (Poet)"

This year promises to be notable as well, with Tishman Speyer, the company that owns and operates Rockefeller Center, continuing to shape the dining scene.

With Workstead, a Brooklyn interior design studio, they have incorporated enough Art Deco features to anchor the soaring room to its historic setting. A verdigris screen separates the bar, terrazzo floors are new but don’t look it and bare burled wood tables sit at forest-green leather banquettes. Mr. Hanson and Mr. Nasr have to fill 130 seats indoors with another 70 on the terrace, and, to do so, especially with a potential tourist audience, they have given an international spin to the menu. “We’ve gone simpler than Frenchette, which has its own personality,” Mr. Hanson said. Mr. Nasr cited some classic brasserie items, like leeks vinaigrette, escargots, pâté maison and steak au poivre (made with bison). They share a menu, divided into Cette Semaine (weekly specials) and Tout le Temps (every day), which also lists falafel, a brochette of calamari and shishito peppers, and barbajuans, a kind of fried ravioli. Some items play it coy, using untranslated French names, like tablier de sapeur (breaded tripe) and cervelle de canut (fresh herbed cheese). In charge of the kitchen as executive chef is Walker Stern, a former owner of Battersby and Dover in Brooklyn. Mariah Neston is collaborating with Michelle Palazzo, the head pastry chef, on site to create a giant baba au rhum carved tableside.
