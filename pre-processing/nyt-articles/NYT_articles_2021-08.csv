When they opened Le Crocodile, the French brasserie on the hotel’s ground floor, the partners, Jon Neidich and the chefs Aidan O’Neal and Jake Leiber, had their eye on a sixth-floor space for a wine bar. So in May 2019, they opened it as Lemon’s, with a breezy Coastal Italian approach. “It was meant to be temporary, a pop-up,” Mr. Neidich said. “It did not have a full kitchen, and we planned to renovate it.” Closing for Covid gave the partners more than a year to install the kitchen and redo the space, which offered views of the Empire State Building. The partners were inspired by Parisian neo-bistros and wine bars. “Their quality is at a high level, but they’re more informal than restaurants,” Mr. Neidich said. The menu features small plates, many of them with seafood like lobster salad, oysters and salmon rillettes. A few more substantial items include halibut and chips, and paella rice with duck and snails. Among the desserts is chocolate babka with salted caramel ice cream. The wine list, assembled by the beverage director Rafa García Febles, is global and lengthy, with many choices by the glass and several nonalcoholic drinks, for which Mr. Neidich said he sees increasing demand. Warm oak walls, banquettes, green velvet and golden lighting define the space, which seats 70 in several areas, including an outdoor terrace.","Bar Blondeau Opens in the Wythe Hotel in Williamsburg, Brooklyn",2021-08-03T16:13:11+0000,article,Food,News,"Restaurants;Bars and Nightclubs;Wythe Hotel (Brooklyn, NY);Bar Blondeau (Brooklyn, NY, Bar);New York City"

Today, he’s known for immortalizing the work of the 20th-century architect Horace Gifford with his 2013 book, “Fire Island Modernist,” and for his own reimaginings of midcentury styles and spaces — he recently completed a restoration of a late ’60s Harry Bates-designed home in Fire Island Pines. Moving uptown, says Rawlins, would allow him to reconceptualize his life. “I realized I didn’t have to be a cool kid in the Village and that, if I worked out of my home, I could call the shots professionally,” he says. And so he and his then-partner, the artist Tad Mike, purchased two units in the same 1935 cream brick co-op — a 700-square-foot one-bedroom to live in, and a 1,050-square-foot two-bedroom two floors below to use for their studios — and Rawlins launched his own practice.",An Elegant Inwood Apartment Designed for Living and Working,2021-08-05T19:21:40+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Interior Design and Furnishings;ARCHITECTURE;Home Repairs and Improvements;Inwood (Manhattan, NY);Rawlins, Christopher;Content Type: Personal Profile"

Though his company imports 22 different oils, some are worth knowing, like leccino oils by Pruneti, a classic; and Sàgona, more forceful, $59.99 for both. A new oil for his company is the herbaceous Fonte di Foiano 1979 from the Bolgheri region, sold as part of a set of six from areas in and around Chianti for $157.50. Also in that set is the Volpaia from the Classico district, a blend of several olives that’s deep green, minty and viscous with bracing bitterness. The oils, all sold in half-liter bottles, are to use for finishing, not sautéing, to elevate a bowl of pappa al pomodoro or grilled fennel, or to trace over slices of rosemary-scented pork roast.",At Least One Thing Good Came Out of 2020,2021-08-09T19:22:26+0000,article,Food,News,Olive Oil;Rare Wine Co;Tuscany (Italy)

A new naturally green salt substitute produced from salicornia, a halophyte, has hit the market. Decades ago, José Ramón Noriega planted salicornia on salt-affected farmland in northern Baja California, Mexico. Now his sons, Paul, Erick and Irving Noriega, and another partner, Chris Lin, are cultivating the crop organically, dehydrating and pulverizing it to make a salty powder they call Green Salt. It’s salty enough to use in place of table salt, though it’s substantially lower in sodium. It adds a nice touch of vegetal flavor when dusted atop a deviled egg, baked potato or sautéed fish. That flavor disappears in cake batter or pasta sauce. While Green Salt is more costly than regular kosher or sea salt, it’s comparable in price to many boutique salts.",Add Green to Your Salt Lineup,2021-08-09T19:28:34+0000,article,Food,News,Salt;Cooking and Cookbooks;Mexico

They’re the YouTube of books, perfect for easily distracted types, and there’s a new one at No. 1 on the middle grade hardcover list: “Black Boy Joy: 17 Stories Celebrating Black Boyhood,” edited by Kwame Mbalia, author of the Tristan Strong trilogy. His collection includes contributions from Jerry Craft, Tochi Onyebuchi and Jason Reynolds, and explores sexual identity, intergalactic warfare, skateboarding and loss. With irresistibly named tales like “There’s Going to Be a Fight in the Cafeteria on Friday and You Better Not Bring Batman,” the vibe is playful with a side of gravity; as Mbalia writes, “Grab your string cheese. Prepare to laugh, cry and maybe even dance, but most of all, prepare to feel joyful.” At the moment, “Black Boy Joy” is the only anthology on the middle grade list — but readers may also be interested in Joanna Farrow’s “The Official Harry Potter Baking Book,” currently at No. 3, which teaches kids how to whip up Wand Breadsticks, Quidditch Pitch Focaccia and Whomping Willow Cheese Straws.","Joy, Flexibility and Bravery Land on the Best-Seller List",2021-08-12T09:00:04+0000,article,Books,List,"Books and Literature;Black People;Blacks;Politics and Government;World War II (1939-45);Impeachment;Abbott, Megan (1971- );Fish-Harnack, Mildred;Mbalia, Kwame;Onyebuchi, Tochi;Vindman, Alexander S;All the Frequent Troubles of Our Days: The True Story of the American Woman at the Heart of the German Resistance to Hitler (Book);The Turnout (Book);Today (TV Program);You Will Know Me (Book)"

The elixirs can be added to sparkling water, teas, coffees, kombucha, milks and very pretty infusions; consumed as plain shots and mocktails; and bottled to take home. Gluten-free vegan snacks like banana bread, muffins, cookies and quiches are served. The bright white store, with vintage touches, has a small bar and a communal table. Mr. Sagar said he vetted his sources for botanicals very carefully; on the company’s website there’s an excellent disclaimer about the efficacy of herbal remedies.",Sidle Up to This Bar for an Herbal Infusion,2021-08-16T20:32:44+0000,article,Food,News,"SoHo (Manhattan, NY);Bars and Nightclubs"

Around the same time, two men working 800 miles apart — the Austrian printer Count Alois von Beckh Widmanstätten and Guglielmo Thomson, an English mineralogist based in Naples — made a similar discovery: If one treats a split-open iron-based meteorite with a mild nitric acid solution, a strikingly intricate crystalline grid emerges. Today, the motif is referred to as the Widmanstätten patterns or the Thomson structures, but no matter who gets credit, they are among nature’s most hypnotic creations. Rolex, the Swiss watchmaker, has used meteorite for its dials in the past, backing thin slices of it with brass, but now, the company has reimagined its iconic Cosmograph Daytona with a face made from a solid slab of chemically treated fallen star. Encased in rose gold, white gold or yellow gold (as pictured), the etched surface lends the famously sophisticated timepiece an otherworldly patina — literally — that practically lifts it into the stratosphere.

With its contoured, soap bar-shaped back and seat, connected by two arcs of molded plywood, it was covered in two-tone Vipla, an Italian marine vinyl.

Now, in collaboration with the Ponti archives, the Italian furniture brand Molteni & C has reimagined the work in ash wood and covered in a variety of textiles and leathers, including this terra-cotta-colored linen.

By the 1920s, the maison was experimenting with exotic Art Deco creations and, in the early ’30s, it pioneered a groundbreaking new technique called the Mystery Set, by which gemstones could be arranged in a mosaiclike pattern without any visible supports. Its sautoirs, minaudières and brooches quickly became favorites among royals and Hollywood stars including Marlene Dietrich, for whom Van Cleef created one of its most iconic designs, the Jarretière bracelet, in 1937. The story goes that Dietrich gave a handful of her gemstone-studded pieces to Louis Arpels, the brother of Estelle and one of the company’s founders, and asked him to create something special. And so the Jarretière was born: The modernist platinum cuff featured an exaggerated, asymmetrical loop covered in cushion-cut rubies set atop twin bucklelike bands of baguette-and-pavé-set white diamonds. (The piece’s name translates to “garter,” and indeed the design resembles the band worn around the top of a woman’s stocking.) Dietrich famously wore it in Alfred Hitchcock’s 1950 noir thriller, “Stage Fright” (she also insisted on head-to-toe Dior for the role), and to the Academy Awards a year later.",A Celestial Cuff Modeled After One Made for Marlene Dietrich,2021-08-20T13:00:07+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Jewels and Jewelry;Van Cleef & Arpels;Dietrich, Marlene;Bos, Nicolas"

Rather, challah rolls with apple filling make suitable stand-ins, and the dough can be used to make one large loaf. The recipe for pletzel, a Polish specialty that’s also called onion board, deserves to be added to your flatbread collection. The book taps traditions, including those of Sephardic and Mizrachi cultures, in addition to Ashkenazic.

In the space that was Leonelli Restaurant and Bar, they’ve pivoted from Italian to French, with the bar, tables and an open kitchen dedicated to bistro fare, and changed the name to Bar Benno. The elegant flagship Benno, which has three stars from The New York Times, in the back of the space will not change, except to feature more seafood when it’s ready for diners in a month or so. But now, fitted with a huge back bar and a U-shaped counter with seating, the new spot, called Bar Benno, will feature a cold seafood selection, and hors d’oeuvres like escargots, egg in a potato crust, pâté de campagne, and Basque-style tripe on its classic menu. Main courses include rotisserie chicken, steak au poivre and bourride, a rich Provençal seafood stew rarely seen on New York menus. Fries will come alongside steamed mussels, a French dip sandwich and steak tartare. From 5 to 7 p.m., with aperitifs and cocktails, there will be savories like deviled eggs with caviar, salmon rillettes, white anchovies with bread and butter, and fried pig’s trotter with sauce gribiche. “I didn’t feel it was enough just to reopen as we were before,” Mr. Benno said. “I’ve been cooking French most of my whole career, so I’m very comfortable with this. Fortunately, we did not have to do a big renovation.” Mr. Benno also said that it was difficult for Leonelli Restaurant and Bar, an Italian taverna, to establish its own personality. But, he said, offering bistro fare in a space that’s something of a prelude to the Benno dining room and that leans toward France made more sense. A taste of Italy with flatbread pizzas, breads and pastries remains available in Leonelli Bakery in the front of the building.
