The 32-year-old actor had been to Cannes twice before and had experienced its queasy jitters, spurred by drinking too much, sleeping too little and feeling eyeballs scan his face to gauge his importance. (“L.A., but times 50,” he said.) But this time, all eyeballs were fixed on him as he clutched the awards podium like a fainting chaise. “I think I’m going to throw up,” he sputtered. The audience tittered, uncertain if his panic was a bit. Then Jones fled the stage, leaving in his wake a few exhalations that lingered like dust clouds from a cartoon roadrunner: “I am so sorry — I cannot do this. Thank you so much.”",Caleb Landry Jones Can Do This,2022-04-01T21:10:14+0000,article,Movies,News,"Movies;Jones, Caleb Landry (1989- );Nitram (Movie);Cannes International Film Festival;Content Type: Personal Profile;Actors and Actresses;Davis, Judy;Kurzel, Justin;Awards, Decorations and Honors"

So he stepped in. The prime tomahawk steak ($130), once seared, then finished in a slow oven, was quite tender and had rich flavor. At around 40 ounces, it serves two to four. The choice grade tomahawk is $100. There are also short ribs, rib steaks and roasts, prime or choice, as well as lamb and veal. The meats are shipped frozen.

Maybe this is because they don’t know how billionaires affect their lives or what political power they wield; maybe it’s just because a billion is such an unfathomably large number. A decade or so ago, three political scientists at Northwestern University, Benjamin Page, Jason Seawright and Matthew Lacombe, set out to determine the impact that superrich Americans have on congressional and presidential policies. They weren’t starting from scratch; previous work done by another political scientist, Martin Gilens, used years of surveys of thousands of poor, middle-income and affluent Americans to show that policymakers responded almost exclusively to the preferences of that last group. Following this earlier research, Page told me recently, “I wanted to find out how much influence the truly wealthy have and what they want from government.” Page and his colleagues wanted to do a quantitative analysis of political inequality.

1882,Les Murray’s posthumous collection “Continuous Creation” highlights both his crankiness and the rough magnificence of the landscape he loved.,"Born and raised in New South Wales, Australia, Les Murray was gaptoothed, pigheaded, booming, burly. (He would have said fat.) His childhood in Bunyah was not a long way from nowhere — you’d have to pass Coolongolook, Cooranbong and a lot of other one-kangaroo towns to get to Sydney, three hours away. A lover of the outback, molded but not deformed by university, he was proud of not belonging, boasting his degree the “least distinguished” ever bestowed by the University of Sydney. The best poet Australia had seen for a generation or two, by his early 30s he lived in partial exile from the literary scene. His longing for the bush grew until in his 40s he moved back to part of the old family dairy farm.","One Last Book From an Outback Poet Who Was Part Hero, Part Pariah",2022-04-15T04:01:07+0000,article,Books,Review,"Poetry and Poets;Books and Literature;Murray, Les;Continuous Creation: Last Poems (Book)"

What about the end of our own lives? What should we say if we can’t do anything? Such questions have a history in poems as old as the history of poems: They animate funeral elegies, prayers to forestall the apocalypse, deathbed repentance like John Donne’s. And they have new resonance now, when climate change and global plague and general public exhaustion have put so many of us into such a rough mood, “casting about for ways to summon normal,” as the careful, careworn, learned Michigan poet Linda Gregerson says. Gregerson’s seventh collection tries patiently and concisely to support our aging bodies, our battered ecosystems and our traditions of memorable speech, along with her own Midwestern immigrant heritage with its “Scandinavian Grim.”","A Poet Looks at the End of the World, and Reaches for Hope",2022-04-15T04:01:08+0000,article,Books,Review,"Poetry and Poets;Books and Literature;Gregerson, Linda (1950- );Canopy (Book)"

2333,How might we leverage knowing that a particular neurological feature makes someone more vulnerable to autism or Alzheimer’s or more likely to achieve academically?,"In March, neuroscientists and psychiatrists from the School of Medicine at Washington University, St. Louis, along with colleagues elsewhere, published a study in the journal Nature that sparked widespread discussion in their fields. Researchers, the study noted, are increasingly using magnetic resonance imaging — which can reveal the brain’s structure and activity — to try to find links between what is seen on an M.R.I., like cortical thickness or patterns of connection, and complicated psychological traits, like cognitive ability or mental-health conditions. In theory, such so-called brain-wide association studies could yield incredibly valuable insights. Knowing that a particular neurological feature makes someone more vulnerable to autism, Alzheimer’s or another disorder, for example, could help predict, prevent or treat that condition. Likewise, if we can link certain features to desirable traits, like academic achievement, it might be possible to take advantage of that knowledge.",M.R.I.s Are Finding Connections Between Our Brain Activity and Psychology,2022-04-19T09:00:18+0000,article,Magazine,News,Psychology and Psychologists;Brain;Magnetic Resonance Imagers;Research;Psychiatry and Psychiatrists;Mental Health and Disorders

Since 2016, KYU (pronounced “cue”), in the Wynwood neighborhood of Miami, has been a destination, offering an eclectic, strongly Asian-leaning menu of often wood-fired specialties served in a high-decibel industrial setting. Appetites are vigorously satisfied; creature comforts less so. In New York, there are touches of luxury in the generous space that housed Bobby Flay’s Gato, with dramatic lighting and a glittering sweep of brass mesh to set off the lounge area. Alan Omsky and Jordan Sayfie, the founders, have joined with an English hospitality company, Reuben Brothers, for this expansion of the brand. (There’s already an offshoot in Mexico City, and other locations are in the pipeline.) Its signature is Japanese yakiniku grilling, which will be handled in an open kitchen with a chef’s table by Chris Arellanes, who worked at Per Se and Eleven Madison Park. Smoked Wagyu brisket, whole roasted cauliflower, six-hour smoked short ribs and a towering coconut cake are coming to New York, along with a newly conceived wood-fired bass with fermented brussels sprouts and dashi, and charred sunchokes with Parmesan cream and togarashi lime. The restaurant’s Miami cocktails, like the Wynwood Mule made with house-smoked pineapple, and the spicy shiso sour fueled with Thai chile tincture, are also traveling north.

As Charlayne Hunter-Gault reported for The Times in 1977, a Black economist in Philadelphia said, “It has made the brutality of slavery more vivid for me than anything I’ve seen or read.” To refresh a sense of what an event “Roots” was at the time, recall that the cast included some of the biggest names of the day, including John Amos, Lloyd Bridges and Sandy Duncan.

2617,A surreal depiction of grief that shows how it can change within stasis. ,"This poem in translation is surreal in its depiction of grief. It has a recurring image of a bird that’s a figure for death and grief after the loss of the poet’s father. Don Mee Choi’s translation of the poem captures the eternal void of grief. Repetition mimics grief’s insistence: “Bird cuts me out” in the first and third stanzas, “I exit” throughout and “I take a step toward where I don’t exist,” which is repeated twice near the end of the poem. The poem’s form shows how grief changes within stasis. The second and fourth stanzas echo but swerve, until we get the callback and negation in the final stanza: “Bird doesn’t cut me out.” The final line, “Behind the wall I’m on standby forever,” channels the energy of a lyric poem, a sense of running in place.

2665,Three authors turn the lens on their own bodies and minds.,"The title of Chloé Cooper Jones’s first book — EASY BEAUTY (288 pp., Avid Reader, $28) —comes from a philosophical concept: “Easy beauty” is “apparent and unchallenging,” Jones writes, unlike “difficult beauty,” which requires “time, patience and a higher amount of appreciation.” The fact that she was born with a physical condition, sacral agenesis, that makes her body different — she’s short of stature and has small lower legs — excludes Jones from easy beauty, as well as the ancient Greek conception of “objective beauty.” As “a woman with a body that could never be mistaken for symmetrical or orderly,” she long believed that the only way to deserve anyone else’s respect, much less desire, was to “be extraordinary in all other aspects,” brilliant and witty and humorous and cool. If the book is any proof, Jones is all these things.
