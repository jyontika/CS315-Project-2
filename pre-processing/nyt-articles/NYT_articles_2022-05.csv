535,You can always rely on an Ada Limón poem to give you hope.

This 14-line pseudo-sonnet roughly follows the structure of a Petrarchan sonnet with its octave (first eight lines) stating a tension and the sestet (final six lines) including a volta (or turn). Here, the tension was a child’s divided life due to a parent’s divorce, and the volta begins with, “But let me say ...” which prefaces the final beautiful five lines. Limón is a master at making a simple idea (that of hindsight, seeing the bright side of things) askew. “And so I have/two brains now,” she writes. “Two entirely different brains.” Limón gives us two brains in her poems too, revealing new ways to view the world.

1180,"For his latest project, the architect and artist has created an installation out of LEDs and balloonlike forms that will adorn the Aspen Art Museum’s facade.","More than 60 years into the architect and artist Gaetano Pesce’s career, his doughy-looking, gelatinous furniture is held up as a rebuttal to the uniformity of minimalist design: a modular sofa resembling a city skyline at dusk; a jewel-tone resin cabinet in the shape of a man on all fours; a biomorphic, womblike red armchair tethered to a spherical ottoman — a comment on female subjugation and, he says, “better than Brancusi.” In 2020, when the Aspen Art Museum approached Pesce’s New York gallery, Salon 94 Design, about mounting an exhibition of his objects in the institution’s four-story space, designed by Shigeru Ban and covered on two sides with a severe woven-wood grid, the 82-year-old recalls having said, “I won’t do it in a prison.” As a workaround, Pesce proposed “My Dear Mountains,” a site-specific installation comprising LEDs and 3-D inflatable volumes that would temporarily obscure the building’s facade with the image of a sun setting behind a mountain range on a starry night. “For some reason, they enjoyed the idea,” Pesce explains from his colorful, cluttered studio in the Brooklyn Navy Yard as he examines some sierra-shaped resin vases, which will go on sale in an edition of 25 when the show opens on May 25.","In All That He Does, Gaetano Pesce Looks to Counteract Sameness",2022-05-10T12:00:09+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Pesce, Gaetano;Art;Aspen Art Museum;ARCHITECTURE;Museums;Content Type: Personal Profile"

1185,Plus: a new model of Hermès’s Kelly watch and more from T’s cultural compendium.,"In an age obsessed with the elusive notion of authenticity, restaurants love to say that their menus reflect the spirit of their owners’ own kitchens, a comforting, if often disingenuous, claim. But at Mexico City’s six-month-old Esquina Común — which translates from the Spanish to “common corner” — home is more than a concept. This hidden weekend lunch spot, operated by the chef Ana González Serrano and her partner, Carlos Pérez-Puelles, is run out of a roughly 550-square-foot second-floor apartment on a leafy side street in the city’s Roma district. The former living area is now an extension of the modest dining room, which can seat up to 14 and is decorated with family photos and books from the couple’s own residence. In a newly opened lounge just off the main area, Pérez-Puelles pours wine and mezcal from a hyperpersonal selection. González Serrano, who previously oversaw the corn-based offerings at the city’s acclaimed Expendio de Maíz, cooks in a decidedly noncommercial kitchen (her mother, Beatriz, helps with prep), serving polished yet homey dishes that, on a given weekend, might include cheese-stuffed plantain croquettes with hoja santa chimichurri (recalling the coastal state of Veracruz from which half of González Serrano’s family hails); a tostada heaped with buttery turmeric-spiked lentils that is equal parts Mexico, India and France; or Peruvian red rice with pork ribs and huancaína, a cream sauce she makes with poblanos, alliums and cheese.

1785,This month’s picks include two moon-titled movies and two of Mahershala Ali.,"Benjamin Cleary’s thoughtful film takes place in a near future that feels within reach: People travel on sleek trains and in driverless electric cars; they have cameras in their contact lenses. And while not widespread (yet), human cloning has become a reality. Because he has a terminal illness, Cameron (Mahershala Ali, effortlessly carrying the movie) decides to secretly replace himself with a duplicate so that his wife (Naomie Harris) and their young son will be spared the grief of his death. Cameron elopes to a secluded facility run by Dr. Scott (Glenn Close), where his consciousness is uploaded into a “molecularly regenerated” copy of his body. But then Cameron finds it hard to let go: Cameron 2 is himself — only one small mole differentiates them — and yet he is not, provoking complex feelings of fear, jealousy and defensiveness. One of the few people who understands the predicament is Kate (Awkwafina), a dying woman spending her last days at Dr. Scott’s compound after having been replaced in the outside world by a clone. Bathed in the cold palette and cool details (these characters listen to music on vinyl, of course) that are de rigueur for this type of arty sci-fi, “Swan Song” does get a little mopey, but it is also insightful about the difficulty of making huge decisions. And it posits a situation that may not be all that far-off.",Five Science-Fiction Movies to Stream Now,2022-05-13T15:00:05+0000,article,Movies,News,Movies;Moonfall (Movie);Moonshot (Movie);She Dies Tomorrow (Movie);Swan Song (2021) (Movie);Bubble (2022) (Movie)

So he moved to Albany, N.Y., started catering and considered opening a restaurant. “It’s something I thought I could do,” he said. Now, at age 34, he is a restaurateur, specializing in Cajun and Creole cooking. He enrolled in an online hospitality business program through Cornell University, found advisers and a business partner, and then, because of Covid, was able to pick up a restaurant space at a reasonable rent. His sliver of a restaurant in TriBeCa is named for filé powder, the ground sassafras thickener often used for making gumbo. But he’s from Boise, Idaho, not the Bayou. He said he grew up eating Louisiana fare, which his maternal grandfather, Aubrey Gaines, known as Tiny, would cook at home. (Though he wasn’t a Louisiana native, Mr. Gaines learned the cuisine in his travels with a construction company.) Mr. McCree’s gumbos, including Tiny’s gumbo based on his grandfather’s style, are cooked to order in kettles behind a counter with a long row of tables opposite. They come with a choice of chicken and andouille sausage; seafood; all the above; and vegetarian. Traditional fare like jambalaya, crayfish étouffée, grilled oysters, shrimp Creole, blackened fish and, at lunch, muffuletta and po’ boy sandwiches, are also served.","Filé Gumbo Bar, Offering Cajun and Creole Cooking, Opens in TriBeCa",2022-05-24T16:57:32+0000,article,Food,News,"Restaurants;New York City;TriBeCa (Manhattan, NY);File Gumbo Bar (Manhattan, NY, Restaurant)"

4165,"Upscale Italian from a longtime head captain, Spanish-influenced small plates in the East Village and more restaurant news.","Nearly 200 years ago, the financial district was New York City’s hub for fine dining. With Crown Shy, Harry’s, Nobu Downtown, Temple Court, the new Le Gratin and this gracious restaurant and bar by John Fraser in the Wall Street Hotel, it’s heading in that direction again. The hotel, owned by Paspaley, a major pearl company in Australia, is in a repurposed office building with a mercantile past. (The restaurant’s name — “the merchant” in French — reflects that.) An elegant bar leads to a white-tablecloth dining room with an elaborate raw bar and a couple of semiprivate tables framed in heavy drapes. Despite the formality of the setting, Mr. Fraser hopes to attract what he sees as a younger crowd who live and work in the area, by modernizing the French fare that shaped his career in Paris. “I’m looking at the 21st century, using global ingredients, sometimes out of left field,” he said. He’s supported by his executive chef, Rick Horiike, who worked at Buddakan and Wild Ink. Among the raw-bar items and appetizers on the lengthy menu are beef tartare, asparagus or blue crab enclosed in rice paper rolls; littleneck clams with cilantro mignonette; and lightly seared duck breast, sliced carpaccio-thin, with a drizzle of fish sauce caramel. Main courses include sweet rice with mushrooms cooked in a banana leaf, a version of homard à l’Américaine made with coconut milk, coffee-crusted pork chop with lentils, trout baked with a basting of miso, and roasted or steamed Dover sole for two with vermouth-lime butter. Desserts include a floating island with Japanese-style cheesecake. Amy Racine, the beverage director for Mr. Fraser’s JF Restaurants, will oversee the 120-label wine list that, while mostly French, lists some Australian selections to honor the hotel’s owners.
