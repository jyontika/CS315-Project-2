Subsequent studies showed that soaking up the forest environment — the still atmosphere, the verdant scenery, the gentle crunching of twigs underfoot — reduces cortisol (the body’s primary stress hormone) and activates the parasympathetic (self-healing) nervous system. These findings paved the way for other holistic disciplines, including today’s forest medicine (the study of how wooded environments improve health) and ecotherapy (which considers the curative potential of natural settings).",How to Create an At-Home Forest Bathing Ritual,2021-04-06T19:17:07+0000,article,T Magazine,News,Forests and Forestry;Perfumes and Fragrances;Cosmetics and Toiletries;Japan

But when you immerse yourself in the shifting perspectives of CATHEDRAL (Europa, 624 pp., $28), what you also discover is a clever (even postmodern?) commentary on the ironies of history. As he traces the fates of a lively scrum of characters, Hopkins shows how the seemingly firm hierarchies of one era can be grounded in the social strife — and sometimes sheer luck — of those that came before. In this nimble mesh of stories, a trading empire can have its roots in something as simple as the theft of a wig. And forbidden love can lead to a lonely death or to the birth, many years onward, of a whole new community.","Spanning Centuries and Continents, Novels of Our Common Humanity",2021-04-20T09:00:07+0000,article,Books,Review,"Books and Literature;Cathedral (Book);The Children's Train (Book);Hopkins, Ben (Author);The Adventures and Misadventures of the Extraordinary and Admirable Joan Orpi, Conquistador and Founder of New Catalonia (Book);Besora, Max;Ardone, Viola"
2893,The magazine’s Ethicist columnist on dealing with a parent radicalized by a recommendation engine and whether to cut off a friend who has joined a cult.,"For nearly his entire life, my 80-something-year-old father has been a quiet, gentle and deeply religious man who went to Mass and said the rosary daily. Although his political views have always been conservative, he has also always believed in kindness and fairness. Since the start of the pandemic, his social interactions have become severely reduced, limited to daily calls from me (I live across the country), weekly visits from my brother and the occasional shopping trips and church attendance. As our mother passed away before the pandemic, his one loyal companion has been his iPad and YouTube. Because of his viewing of religious programs, YouTube has increasingly steered him toward conservative media, so that he is now obsessed with right-wing extremist politics and is absolutely against taking the Covid vaccine. Every time my brother or I have a conversation with him, he talks politics and pushes his views, and even after we asked him to stop, he tries to get the last word in by sending us angry emails or texts. Now both of us try to avoid having any interactions with him. I have the password to his YouTube account from a year ago when I helped him with a tech problem. In order to preserve our relationship, I’m thinking about going into his account to delete and pause his viewing history, and perhaps put in some links to more wholesome entertainment such as music and soccer to counter the constant bombardment of extremism. My justification is that if he is being brainwashed by an algorithm, then I might as well use the algorithm to steer him back to his old self so that we can at least have a normal conversation.

3082,"The past year has changed alcohol use patterns, especially among women. The impacts probably won’t be fully known for years.","Even before the pandemic began, some Americans were drinking significantly more alcohol than they had in decades past — with damaging consequences. In 2020, researchers at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (N.I.A.A.A.) found that from 1999 through 2017, per capita consumption increased by 8 percent and the number of alcohol-related deaths doubled, many caused by liver disease. The trends are particularly concerning for women: Whereas the number of men who reported any drinking stayed mostly the same, the proportion of women who did so increased 10 percent, and the number of women who reported binge drinking, or consuming roughly four or more drinks in about two hours, increased by 23 percent. (For men, binge drinking is about five or more drinks in that period.)

3385,The musician and memoirist rediscovered this favorite from her childhood while on a recent trip to Seoul.,"During a three-week visit to Seoul in May 2019, the musician Michelle Zauner saw the city in a nostalgic light. She was staying in an apartment in the Gangnam district to complete the first draft of her memoir, “Crying in H Mart,” following a tour in Asia with her solo indie-pop project, Japanese Breakfast. Though Zauner, 32, grew up in Eugene, Ore., she was born in Seoul, and revisiting the food of her childhood — particularly dotorimuk-muchim, or seasoned acorn jelly, which she ordered often from a noodle restaurant near the apartment — caused new emotions to surface. Traditionally made from foraged acorns that are shelled, dried, ground into a powdery starch, cooked in water and served cold as banchan, or a side dish, its gelatinous texture and earthy flavor triggered a visceral response, first at her fingertips, then on her tongue. “It reminded me of my enduring struggle as a child to keep the slippery bricks between my chopsticks,” Zauner says, adding that the dish is “almost like a Korean aspic, but healthier.”",An Acorn Jelly That Brings Michelle Zauner Back,2021-04-22T19:30:11+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Content Type: Personal Profile;Korean Food (Cuisine);Zauner, Michelle (Japanese Breakfast);South Korea"

Among them are the myriad atrocities perpetuated against Indigenous people in what we now call America (and beyond), individuals whose experiences are to this day too often distorted or left untold. Lately, though, there have been some hard-won gains on that front, from professional sports teams finally changing their names to the Metropolitan Museum of Art hiring Patricia Marroquin Norby as its first curator of Native American Art. It is not necessarily the job of the artist to shine a light where others have not, but self-expression — especially that of individuals who, whether because of their race, gender, sexuality or any other marker of identity, some might seek to deny — can be an inherently radical act, one to which attention should be paid. For this story, we asked 10 queer Indigenous talents from different parts of North America to share one of their artworks and talk about its genesis, and about their practice at large. Like the selections themselves, the conversations, which touched on materials, color schemes, gender fluidity, decolonization, oral history and more, were testaments to the strength — and beauty — of a multiplicity of voices.",10 Queer Indigenous Artists on Where Their Inspirations Have Led Them,2021-04-23T19:35:06+0000,article,T Magazine,News,Art;Indigenous People;Gender;Transgender and Transsexuals;Homosexuality and Bisexuality;ALASKA;British Columbia (Canada);Hawaii;Mexico;New Mexico;Spokane (Wash);Brooklyn (NYC);Portland (Ore);Toronto (Ontario);Hudson (NY)

He closed Lupulo more than three years ago and Aldea a little over a year ago after a 10-year run, because he felt that he needed a break. Now, he will be the chef and a partner at this new SoHo restaurant. He will be running it with David Rabin, a hospitality veteran who is also a partner in the Lambs Club, the new Sona and others. “I always knew I’d be back,” Mr. Mendes said. “I’ve spent the past year cooking at home, baking sourdough and exploring new flavors, and I’m ready to translate them to a restaurant.” Veranda is in the new ModernHaus hotel, a property that was the James, and has been completely reconfigured. Veranda’s main dining room is up from the street, and designed in greenhouse fashion with a retractable ceiling. It’s surrounded by outdoor seating on an upper terrace and a multilevel garden. Mr. Mendes’s menu is global but lightly strewn with Portuguese touches. Think flor de sal (fleur de sel) and olive oil for the sourdough bread, salt cod croquettes, Goan curry for shrimp, and a piri piri marinade used on grilled chicken. Chicken rice is his take on paella. He also delivers seasonality with all the green stuff you hunger for right now. “I’ve been cooking farm-to-table since I worked at Bouley and in France,” he said. “The bounty is incredible now.” A number of products, including the sourdough bread, are sold to take home.
