It was a muggy afternoon in the spring of 2015, and I was in Tokyo at the opening of her new Miu Miu store. I had been waiting in line to congratulate her.

Her arms Pietà’d out as she approached the Italian designer, hands landing confidently on Mrs. Prada’s shoulders, and, as if tracing the line of a toppled-over parabola, she kissed her — mwah — on the left cheek, and then again — mwah — on the right.

I kind of cranked forward and cupped Mrs. Prada’s waist the way a high school junior might initiate a slow dance. Then I lurched even closer, barely grazing one side of her cheek on the first try.

681,Família Geisse from Brazil sells a sparkling wine that you disgorge yourself.,"I’ve sabered open a bottle of Champagne. But disgorging one? Yes, try this at home. Just follow the step-by-step that comes with Família Geisse’s Cave Amadeu Rústico Nature from southern Brazil. In sparkling wine parlance, disgorging refers to extracting the sediment, or lees, that accumulate as the wine develops. Traditionally it’s done by gradually turning the bottle upside down in a special rack, a technique called riddling. Once upended, the sediment falls into the neck of the bottle, which is then briefly frozen so when the cap is removed the frozen plug of sediment is expelled by the carbonation of the wine; the bottle is then corked. And you do not have to be in Mme. Pommery’s chalky cellar in Reims to do it. At home you leave the bottle nearly upside down for a week, then freeze it for 90 minutes, pop off the metal cap and the sediment shoots out. Mine was perfect. It’s best done outside or maybe over a bathtub. The disgorged wine is light, fizzy and pleasant. I also tried a bottle of the wine without disgorging, making it what’s called a pét-nat these days. It was cloudy but with more complexity on the palate. Disgorging is worth trying at least once, and understanding what lees contribute to the wine made it doubly worthwhile.",A Quarantine Activity for the Wine Lover,2020-05-06T01:44:29+0000,article,Food,News,Wines;Brazil;Vinicola Geisse;Quarantine (Life and Culture)

But the pilgrims on my flight from South Korea had an altogether different purpose. It was here, scarcely 15 miles from the airport, among fields now yellow with mustard flowers, that a renunciant prince had, upon gaining enlightenment some 25 centuries ago, given his first sermon, setting what Buddhists call the Wheel of Dharma into motion. At a deer park once called Isipatana, now Sarnath, a 35-year-old Gautama Buddha, hardly older than Christ when he climbed the hill of Calvary, revealed the eightfold path to liberation from suffering, his four noble truths and the doctrine of the impermanence of everything, including the Self. It was to the remains of the monastery and shrine at Sarnath that the pilgrims from East and Southeast Asia came, as pilgrims had for well over 1,500 years, along a subsidiary branch of the Great Silk Road, which ran through the high snowy mountains that girdle the Indian subcontinent into a riverine plain that stretches across what is today Pakistan and north India. The pilgrims took an exit off that highway of goods and ideas that ran from China to Rome in order to honor what may well have been the most influential doctrine to travel along its lines of transmission — the word of the Buddha, and the art made in his name.",How the Buddha Got His Face,2020-05-11T13:00:24+0000,article,T Magazine,News,Buddhism;Pilgrimages;Monasteries and Monks;Nomadic People;Silk Road (Ancient Trade Route);Varanasi (India)

This city of 2.5 million had, in Soviet days, which lasted from the 1920s until the country’s independence in 1991, been the premier capital of Central Asia. It is home to more than half of Uzbekistan’s 116 universities, and on that first golden morning in Tashkent, there was something of the glazed perfection of a Soviet propaganda poster in the sight of students in twos and threes strolling down the runway-size avenues. They were dwarfed by the giant buildings that lined the roads — banks, museums and ministries — “Babylonian blocks,” as the English writer Philip Glazebrook, who had been in Tashkent at the end of Soviet rule, described them in “Journey to Khiva” in the early ’90s: “Since the days of Nineveh this has been the architecture of dictatorship and persecution.” And so it was, but after my late arrival on the Turkish Airlines flight from Istanbul, I found myself oddly in sympathy with the ideal, if not the reality, of Soviet life.","In Uzbekistan, Coming to Terms With the Country’s Dazzling History",2020-05-11T13:00:29+0000,article,T Magazine,News,Uzbekistan;Politics and Government;Restoration and Renovation;Uzbeks (Ethnic Group);Religion and Belief;Bukhara (Uzbekistan);Samarkand (Uzbekistan);Silk Road (Ancient Trade Route)

This is architecture meant to set the soul asoar, but I am conscious only of how far I am below, in the horde at the gates. Down the stairs, the bullet train waits, sleek-nosed and sealed in on itself, like a missile. A stoic janitor steers a Zamboni-like machine down the platform, buffing it to a gleam.

His claim of a 100 percent cure rate shocked scientists around the world.,"When diagnosing the ills afflicting modern science, an entertainment that, along with the disparagement of his critics and fellow researchers, he counts among his great delights, the eminent French microbiologist Didier Raoult will lightly stroke his beard, lean back in his seat and, with a thin but unmistakable smile, declare the poor patient to be stricken with pride. Raoult, who has achieved international fame since his proposed treatment for Covid-19 was touted as a miracle cure by President Trump, believes that his colleagues fail to see that their ideas are the products of mere intellectual fashions — that they are hypnotized by methodology into believing that they understand what they do not and that they lack the discipline of mind that would permit them to comprehend their error. “Hubris,” Raoult told me recently, at his institute in Marseille, “is the most common thing in the world.” It is a particularly dangerous malady in doctors like him, whose opinions are freighted with the responsibility of life and death. “Someone who doesn’t know is less stupid than someone who wrongly thinks he does,” he said. “Because it is a terrible thing to be wrong.”",He Was a Science Star.

1746,A spin on Shakespeare airs on Showtime. And a new animated sitcom with ties to “Rick and Morty” is on Hulu.,"OPHELIA (2019) 10 p.m. on Showtime. The suggestion that Shakespeare wrote “King Lear” during plague lockdown has been widely circulated recently (online, at least), and some ambitious souls may be inspired to take advantage of social distancing to try to write the next great play, novel or TV pilot. For the rest of us, catching up on movies will have to suffice. One option, for those who missed it, is this revisionist take on “Hamlet.” As the title suggests, the movie takes the characters and plot of that Shakespeare play but gives them its own spin: It focuses on Ophelia (Daisy Ridley), the lover of Hamlet (George MacKay), who gets her own story line here as the action of the play takes a back seat. Directed by Claire McCarthy and based on a young adult novel by Lisa Klein, the movie makes for an “interesting exercise and, for the most part, a passably diverting one,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. This, Dargis added, is “Ophelia as a 21st-century heroine, who after a smudge-faced childhood running wild in her king’s castle — and being excluded from studying with the boys — grows into a woman with desires, ambitions and a pronounced rebellious streak.”",What’s on TV Wednesday: ‘Ophelia’ and ‘Solar Opposites’,2020-05-13T05:00:05+0000,article,Arts,News,Television;Movies

The fleet-footed script is based on recordings of conversations Ellams made in barbershops in Africa and London. “The men were just laughing whilst talking about really crazy issues,” Ellams said in an interview with The New York Times last year. “I had one rule: If a topic comes up three times in three different countries, then it has to go into the play.” This production, recorded during the show’s run at the National Theater in London, is streaming until late next week as part of a series of free programming being offered during the pandemic.",What’s on TV Friday: ‘Barber Shop Chronicles’ and ‘Seberg’,2020-05-15T05:00:06+0000,article,Arts,News,Television;Movies

Some of the praise for the show came from James Poniewozik, The Times’s chief television critic, who called it a “gorgeous, melancholy series” starring leads who “have so much chemistry you may need lab goggles.” Poniewozik recently joined The Times’s three book critics — Dwight Garner, Parul Sehgal and Jennifer Szalai — for a discussion I moderated about the show, the novel, the art of adaptation and more. — John Williams, Daily Books Editor","Bringing ‘Normal People’ to Sexy, Soundtracked Life",2020-05-15T09:00:35+0000,article,Books,News,"Normal People (TV Program);Normal People (Book);Books and Literature;Television;Rooney, Sally (Author);Edgar-Jones, Daisy;Mescal, Paul (1996- );Hulu.com"

Nearly eight years after an investigation by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency found that Lance Armstrong had been using performance-enhancing drugs throughout his career — making him a pariah essentially overnight — the disgraced athlete has resurfaced to reflect on his misdeeds.

(Although if you’ve already made up your mind on Armstrong, the former superstar cyclist, this movie might not change it.) The film packs plenty of back story, chronicling his early days as a cyclist, his battle with testicular cancer and the demise of his reputation after he admitted to doping in 2013. Zenovich doesn’t shy away from tough questions, and by interviewing Armstrong’s family, friends, rivals and others, she manages to create an objective portrait of a shunned star.

If she knew how popular “Nanette” was going to be, she says, she would have paced herself instead of putting all her “trauma eggs into one basket.” When Gadsby performed “Douglas” Off Broadway last summer, The New York Times’s theater critic Jesse Green named it a Critic’s Pick and wrote, “‘Douglas’ is angry — even furious — and draws its comic energy from the effort to master and direct that anger into sharp insight and its byproduct, laughter.”",What’s on TV Tuesday: Hannah Gadsby and ‘America’s Got Talent’,2020-05-26T05:00:06+0000,article,Arts,News,Movies;Television

Or maybe you’ve achieved Diamond Medallion WFH status — which includes but is not limited to sending an email from the toilet using the phrase “let’s circle back.” Whether it’s going well or miserably, you are doing your job from where you live.",You Are Not Working From Home,2020-05-26T09:00:11+0000,article,Opinion,Op-Ed,"Work-Life Balance;Telecommuting;Productivity;Labor and Jobs;Coronavirus (2019-nCoV);Zuckerberg, Mark E;Facebook Inc"
3527,CUNY must be saved from needless cuts.,"Last month the administration at Brooklyn College, part of the City University of New York, announced that — in anticipation of a coming budget crisis — departments must reduce their course offerings by 25 percent. This will mean firing large numbers of adjunct professors, some of whom will lose their health insurance, in the middle of a pandemic. (Mass firings have already started at other CUNY campuses, 450 to date at John Jay alone; they could happen at Brooklyn any day.) Remaining classes will then swell, which is bad for in-person education, but worse if classes remain online, as anybody who has tried to teach on Zoom can attest. The administration has said the projected savings from terminating adjuncts and ballooning classes at Brooklyn College would be $1.4 million. On the scale of New York State’s budget, the system’s main funding source, that’s a rounding error; for our adjuncts and our students, it’s a disaster. After years of being brutalized by Albany, CUNY has apparently so thoroughly internalized the backward logic of austerity that it responds to crisis by attacking itself.",The Backward Logic of Austerity Threatens America’s Most Vibrant Campus,2020-05-26T09:00:11+0000,article,Opinion,Op-Ed,"E-Learning;Colleges and Universities;Budgets and Budgeting;Coronavirus (2019-nCoV);City University of New York;Brooklyn College, City University of New York;Cuomo, Andrew M;New York State"

For his follow-up, “Joan of Arc,” Dumont focuses on Joan of Arc’s later years, this time using electronic pop music to help tell the story. The film casts one of the performers who played Joan in Dumont’s earlier movie, Lise Leplat Prudhomme, opposite the French pop singer Christophe, who plays one of the priests who try Joan. “Here and in the earlier picture it’s perhaps easy to apprehend Dumont’s approach with a ‘What’s this oddball up to now?’ smirk,” Glenn Kenny wrote in his review for The New York Times. “But if Dumont is joking at all, it’s a form of what used to be called ‘kidding on the square.’”",What’s on TV Thursday: ‘Joan of Arc’ and ‘Princess Mononoke’,2020-05-28T05:00:10+0000,article,Arts,News,Television;Movies
