From one angle, it is a collection of muscle fibers and connective tissue, just another organ pulsing away in the abdomen. From another, it is a locus of myth and mystery, a site of alchemical transformation from which all humanity springs.

It is a place where normative standards of gender meet an intricate interplay of hormones, microbiota and cell communication.

781,Being a war movie in the Oscar race has its pros and cons.,"The only thing Oscar prognosticators like more than determining a front-runner for best picture is upending one, and this year’s front-runner would seem to be “Everything Everywhere All At Once.” It’s easy to consider it a shoo-in, as it nabbed honors from such traditional bellwethers as the Gothams, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, the Directors Guild of America and (most recently) the Producers, Screen Actors and Writers guilds. But there have been murmurs throughout awards season that “Everything Everywhere” couldn’t go all the way, that it was too quirky, too weird, too much to win best picture.

783,A guide to some of the undervalued 20th-century works that testify to the richness of the Black American literary archive.,"Fifty years ago, when college courses in Black American literature were rare; when Zora Neale Hurston’s novels were out of print and Toni Morrison was a book editor with one novel to her name, the job of shaping a Black canon was clear: Rediscover, anthologize, define the terms of a tradition. “The act of recovery means something different now,” says Kenton Rambsy, an associate professor of English and digital humanities at the University of Texas at Arlington, whose research uses data analytics to tell new stories about the Black literary past. Sometimes recovery demands peering into the shadows cast by towering canonical figures. “It might mean finding that writer who is just being overlooked because of the canonicity of, say, Toni Morrison,” Rambsy says. Sometimes it’s even simpler than that. “We don’t have to go deep into archives to find undervalued Black authors,” says the poet and U.C.L.A. English professor Harryette Mullen. In a recent essay, I look to such undervalued authors and works as the impetus for shaping a new Black canon.","The New Black Canon: Books, Plays and Poems That Everyone Should Know",2023-03-07T17:00:17+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Books and Literature;Writing and Writers;Poetry and Poets;Black People;Blacks;Theater;Hopkins, Pauline E (1859-1930);Of One Blood (Book);Himes, Chester;Lonely Crusade (Book);Ross, Fran (1935-85);Oreo (Book);Mills Newman, Alison;Francisco (Book);McPherson, James Alan;Elbow Room (Book);Demby, William (1922-2013);Love Story Black (Book);Cooper, J California (1932-2014);The Wake of the Wind (Book);Toomer, Jean;Balo (Play);Spence, Eulalie (1894-1981);The Starter (Play);Hansberry, Lorraine;Toussaint (Play);Gordone, Charles;No Place to Be Somebody (Play);Kennedy, Adrienne;An Evening with Dead Essex (Play);Hairston, Andrea (1952- );Lonely Stardust (Play);Popel, Esther;Collected Poems of Bob Kaufman (Book);Kaufman, Bob;Brooks, Gwendolyn;A Secretary to the Spirits (Book);Reed, Ishmael;The Women of Plums: Poems in the Voices of Slave Women (Book);Kendrick, Dolores (1927-2017);Love's Instruments (Book);Dixon, Melvin;Ai (1947-2010);Vice: New and Selected Poems (Book);United States"

Aging is scary, so intrepid (and murderous) Spanish explorers trekked into the swamps of Florida in search of the fabled Fountain of Youth.

1096,"Claudette Johnson emerged in Thatcher-era England as a prominent Black feminist, only to fall into obscurity. Now, she’s having her first solo show in New York.","In 1979, as Margaret Thatcher came to power, a collective of young Black artists based in the British West Midlands founded the Blk Art Group. Their goal was to amplify Black voices, critique their exclusion from art history and draw attention to the racism they experienced as children of Caribbean migrants in conservative Britain. Claudette Johnson, born in Manchester in 1959, and studying at Wolverhampton Polytechnic at the time, joined the Blk Art Group soon after its formation and began working and exhibiting alongside her fellow members Eddie Chambers, Keith Piper, Marlene Smith and Donald Rodney. “The Black arts community that I became a part of in the ’80s was invaluable. It gave me people to talk to about my work. It made me feel a part of a movement,” says Johnson. “There was definitely a belief that we were going to change things. That we were shaking things up.” But despite this fervent start, the spotlight soon faded and the group’s contribution to contemporary art became largely overshadowed by the provocations of the Young British Artists, the loose affiliation that included Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin. “We just couldn’t fit in in the way the Y.B.A.s could,” Johnson says.",An Artist Returns After a ‘Long Wilderness’,2023-03-09T20:48:36+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Art;Content Type: Personal Profile;Black People;Blacks;Johnson, Claudette (1959- );Ortuzar Projects (Manhattan, NY);Great Britain"

It’s all about luck, happenstance, the roll of the dice … at least, that’s what we tell ourselves. Underneath all that chance is a fundamental truth: Some people have more access to the “right” places, and more resources and support to get out of the “wrong” ones.

5491,"Cedar Sigo’s short poem creates tremendous effect in its few lines, finding a transcendent kinship with the jazz maestro.","Short poems operate in that liminal space between “literary object” and “jotted-down thought.” They are usually casual and generally cunning, seeming to spontaneously respond to everyday stimuli — a half-read library book, the music in the air, a movement seen out of the corner of one’s eye. They are so often hidden away in notebooks and only years later, if ever, realized as poetry as such. I suspect if we could, by some miracle, find all the short poems waiting in notebooks or scribbled on envelope backs and string them together, humans would finally have, to the absurdity and beauty of this world, an adequate response. Until we have it all, I am grateful that at least we have Cedar Sigo’s “The Life of Sun Ra.” It creates, in its few lines, tremendous effect. Sigo finds in the jazz maestro Sun Ra a transcendent kinship. To be a stranger to this world is no bad thing when Jupiter awaits the homecoming of its blessed weirdos. The practice is the art.

5532,"Plus: Ai Weiwei’s first design-focused exhibition, Italian Easter pastries made with balsamic vinegar and more recommendations from T Magazine.","Visitors expecting shiny new things from the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei’s first design-focused exhibition will be in for a surprise. “Ai Weiwei: Making Sense,” which opens at London’s Design Museum on April 7, features broken ceramics and historic relics, including spouts of wine ewers from the Song dynasty (960 to 1279) and fragments of the artist’s own sculptures destroyed in 2018, when the Chinese authorities demolished his Beijing studio. Born in 1957, Ai grew up during the Cultural Revolution in China, a time when the government, as he puts it, went to great lengths to erase evidence of the past that might contradict its rule. Now based in Portugal, the artist says that ruins are slices of history that are essential to human development. “Every ‘advance’ is built on failures,” he explains. “It’s only through these fragments that we have the possibility of redefining history.” As its title suggests, the show will encourage people to make sense of these objects, which are strewn across the Design Museum’s floor alongside Stone Age tools and Lego bricks that Ai has collected over the years. While viewers explore the exhibition, Ai wants them to question what they value and why. Sculptures of toilet rolls — mundane objects that became almost sacred during the pandemic — cast in marble and glass should bring home the point. “Ai Weiwei: Making Sense” is on view from April 7 to July 30, designmuseum.org.","Natural Wines That Channel Berlin, Down to the Spray-Paint Label",2023-03-30T13:00:08+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Art;Ai Weiwei;Wines;Restaurants;Quin, Lauren (Artist);Faurschou New York;Sodi, Bosco;Lucciola (Manhattan, NY, Restaurant)"
