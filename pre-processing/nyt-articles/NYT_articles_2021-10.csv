Its new bag updates the technique with a novel weave.","Bottega Veneta began in 1966 as a leather-goods company based in the Italian town of Vicenza, focused on quiet sophistication and meticulous craftsmanship. Nearly a decade later, the brand debuted a collection of handbags, made by artisans in the Veneto region, using a centuries-old weaving method called intrecciato, meaning “intertwined.” That style — which involves interlocking long, fettuccine-thin strips of leather into a braided pattern that resembles a lattice pie crust — quickly became the leitmotif of the house, known for refraining from logos altogether. In the ’80s, Lauren Hutton carried one of its intrecciato clutches in “American Gigolo” (1980), and Andy Warhol, who often turned to Bottega for his Christmas shopping, was photographed holding up a braided loafer in a department store. (The artist was such a fan of the brand that he produced a short film for the company in 1985.) To teach future artisans the intrecciato method, which takes up to three years of training to master, Bottega partnered with the Scuola d’Arte e Mestieri in Vicenza, an institution devoted to handmaking crafts such as leather goods.",A Classic Clutch With a New Twist,2021-10-01T16:05:08+0000,article,T Magazine,News,Bottega Veneta;Leather and Leather Goods;Fashion and Apparel;Accessories (Apparel);Handbags and Purses

Those early memories of “color blocking,” as he calls it, eventually found vivid expression in Ilori’s work: The artist uses kaleidoscopic hues and energetic shapes in an eclectic range of projects, from architecture and furniture to public sculpture and urban interventions. Whether he’s creating carnivalesque cultural and social spaces (like his summer installation in the courtyard of London’s historic Somerset House) or reimagining forgotten elements of the cityscape (swathing a dreary underpass in rainbow tones), he seeks to spark euphoria and foster connection via an aesthetic that marries the sensory richness of his Nigerian heritage with pristine yet provocative designs.",The Artist Who Dreamed Up a Kaleidoscopic Basketball Court for London’s Canary Wharf,2021-10-04T09:00:29+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Chairs;Furniture;Art;ARCHITECTURE;Design;Interior Design and Furnishings;Ilori, Yinka;Content Type: Personal Profile"

The couple, based in Portland, Ore., and Los Angeles, have been married for 18 years and have worked under the same roof, more or less, since first striking up a friendship in a San Francisco bookstore in the ’90s. And though the bulk of their oeuvres are distinct — Johanson is considered a linchpin of the Mission School, the post-punk movement that borrowed from both graffiti and folk art, for his colorful semi-figurative paintings, while Jackson is known for exploring the poetic and surrealist potential of handmade household objects, as with a U-shaped porcelain candelabra or a sculpture that incorporates sweaters she hand-knit — the couple have also been quietly collaborating for a decade on collage-like salvaged-wood furniture and functional structures, which populate their own home and studios. This fall, some of these pieces will make their way into his-and-hers solo shows in New York (Johanson’s opens in October at Mitchell-Innes & Nash, Jackson’s in November at Tennis Elbow at The Journal Gallery), each offering an immersive view of the artists’ range and overlap during this recent housebound era.",An Artist Couple Who Live Among the Furniture They Create Together,2021-10-04T09:00:32+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Art;Interior Design and Furnishings;Chairs;Sculpture;Tables;Wood and Wood Products;Handicrafts;Design;Johanson, Chris;Jackson, Johanna (Artist)"
376,"An antidote to earth-toned minimalism, Ellen Van Dusen’s designs suggest that children aren’t the only ones drawn to bold colors and shapes.","As a child, Ellen Van Dusen became fixated on the kinetic colors in the artist Ellsworth Kelly’s paintings, which she’d come upon during her frequent museum visits in Washington, D.C., where she grew up. She was puzzled by Kelly’s abstract minimalist works, several of which comprise flat, solid stretches of a single shade; “I was like, ‘It’s just a green canvas; what’s wrong with my brain?’” says the 35-year-old owner of the textiles and home-accessories brand Dusen Dusen. Such questions stuck with her when she was an undergraduate at Tufts, where she majored in a multidisciplinary mix of art history, neuroscience and visual anthropology. “I studied the visual process from different angles,” she says. “Neuroscience is where I focused on vision: how things come through the eye, how they’re processed through the brain and what evolutionarily draws the eye.” But she kept coming back to color.",A Textile Designer Who Draws on Art History and Neuroscience,2021-10-04T09:02:51+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Beds and Bedding;Textiles;Design;Interior Design and Furnishings;Van Dusen, Ellen"

His advice was to stop amassing and start selling. Holladay agreed, and before long she’d graduated from knickknacks to more substantial pieces. “I started out with little marketplace finds, but then found one amazing item and made a huge profit off it,” she says; it was a modular channel bouclé sofa she sold to the model Elsa Hosk, who bought it prior to an Architectural Digest shoot featuring her SoHo apartment. That such a transaction was eminently iterative was not lost on her: “I repeated this process of saving up to buy one really great item and reselling it,” she says.",How a Design Devotee Turned Her Passion Into a Thriving Business,2021-10-04T09:02:51+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Interior Design and Furnishings;Tables;Shopping and Retail;Chairs;Furniture;Holladay, Maggie;Content Type: Personal Profile"

For Arati Rao, the founder of the Brooklyn-based rug and textiles company Tantuvi, the site is a wonder — partly because though it looks like a contemporary art installation, it was actually built by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II in the early 18th century. “It always just blows my mind,” she says. “The curves, the lines — it feels so modern and fresh.” It’s a place that Rao, 39, goes on almost every trip she makes to India (pre-pandemic, she would typically visit once or twice a year) and that frequently sparks inspiration for her creations, which have abstract and geometric properties of their own.",The Rug Designer Inspired by the Colors and Craft Traditions of India,2021-10-04T09:02:52+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Textiles;Art;Carpets and Rugs;Design;Interior Design and Furnishings;India;Rao, Arati;Content Type: Personal Profile"

380,"Minjae Kim’s sculptural pieces, from rabbit-eared wood and fiberglass chairs to a desk inspired by Henri Matisse’s cutouts, have earned him a devoted following.","Minjae Kim’s studio in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is littered with blocks of wood being shaped into something more, but only two pieces in the space appear to be finished: a lamp in one corner resembling a giant oyster and pearl on a pedestal, a self-illuminating sculpture poised somewhere between art and design; and, on the wall above, a painting by his mother, MyoungAe Lee. If his work space leaves an inchoate impression on this August afternoon, it’s likely because the 32-year-old designer hasn’t had time to fully inhabit it, having quit his job at the prestigious design firm Studio Giancarlo Valle only a few weeks earlier in order to become a furniture designer full-time. His decision to venture out on his own was the culmination of a heady year and a half, during which Kim established himself as one of the most sought-after furniture makers in the contemporary design space, using primarily wood and fiberglass to fashion chairs, tables, lamps and cabinets possessed of a poetic, off-kilter presence. “It’s very wild,” he says of his recent dizzying ascent. “It gives me some anxiety, too, because I feel like it could go away so easily.”","An In-Demand Maker of Poetic, Off-Kilter Furniture",2021-10-04T09:02:52+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Furniture;Chairs;Interior Design and Furnishings;Design;Wood and Wood Products;Kim, Minjae;Content Type: Personal Profile"

But now, while my wife slept at night, I would stand over our daughter’s bassinet, compare her face at one week with photos of myself at that delicate, lumpen age and worry about what it might mean to have an Asian-looking baby in this America rather than one who could either pass or, at the very least, walk around with the confidence of some of the half-Asian kids I had met — tall, beautiful, with strange names and a hard edge to their intelligence.",The Myth of Asian American Identity,2021-10-05T09:00:18+0000,article,Magazine,News,"Race and Ethnicity;Asian-Americans;Kang, Jay Caspian;United States;Content Type: Personal Profile"

633,"An excerpt from “My Monticello,” by Jocelyn Nicole Johnson","We claimed it first, this little mountain. Me and MaViolet and a scattering of neighbors, all of us fleeing First Street after men came to set our row of tin-roofed homes on fire. The men came at dusk blaring an operatic O say can you see. White heads rose up from dusty Jeeps and dark hair thrashed in a harsh new wind like tattered flags. OURS! the men shouted. Their rifles gleamed as if they’d only just been bought: a megastore militia. Through a hasty breach in MaViolet’s blinds, I even saw a boy among them, blond and sneering in a pickup window. Men leapt from back seats, sprang out of truck beds, and rushed toward the faces of our homes. White hands clutched metal canisters, swung torches spilling flames. Bright shouts, the rising haze of smoke— all that and more rousted us out. From our patchy front yards, we saw bodies blur as some of our neighbors charged forward to try to stop them. We saw a teen struck with the butt of a rifle, his temple spraying red. A toddler flailed, diapered and clinging to its mother’s hip as she sank knees first to the sidewalk. What we saw in those moments riveted us, and then it set us free.","‘My Monticello,’ by Jocelyn Nicole Johnson: An Excerpt",2021-10-05T21:34:31+0000,article,Books,Review,

1602,"In an essay adapted from remarks he delivered at PEN America’s annual literary gala, the renowned Harvard scholar and author argues that readers and writers must be allowed to engage freely with subjects of their choice.","“The freedom to write”: PEN America’s always resonant motto has a special resonance for Black authors, because for so many of them, that freedom was one they fought hard for. “Liberation” and “literacy” were inextricable. “For the horrors of the American Negro’s life there has been almost no language,” as James Baldwin once noted. Recall, first, that in many states it was illegal for an enslaved person even to learn how to read and how to write. Then the barbarities of the slave trade, the Middle Passage and cradle-to-grave bondage, were followed by another century of lynching, Jim Crow segregation, disenfranchisement and officially sanctioned forms of violence. Does the English language fail us, Baldwin wonders, in the face of racist terror? No, he decides; we must embrace it, occupy it, refashion it in our images, speak it in our own voices. We must deploy it to redress this terror. “To accept one’s past — one’s history,” as Baldwin insisted, “is not the same as drowning with it; it is learning how to use it.” This, surely, is integral to the freedom to write — the freedom to bear witness to the full range of our common humanity, and all that that entails, no matter how uncomfortable the process can be.",Henry Louis Gates Jr. on Literary Freedom as an Essential Human Right,2021-10-12T19:52:15+0000,article,Books,News,"Books and Literature;Race and Ethnicity;Gates, Henry Louis Jr;Baldwin, James (1924-87);Du Bois, W E B;Soyinka, Wole;Civil Rights and Liberties"

The flapper’s boyish silhouette became the ideal, leading to the popularity of the sautoir, a long necklace often ending in a tassel, strung with tiny pearls or gemstones, that nestled against the breastbone. It could be twirled languidly as one stood in sophisticated conversation during the cocktail hour — a ritual that was born during that heady era.

In a two-tiered library adorned with dark wood and the Hungarian flag, Carlson sat across from the prime minister in Budapest with an expression of intense concentration, though he evinced little familiarity with the internal affairs of Hungary. The trip was hastily arranged after Orban agreed to the interview: Carlson dined at the prime minister’s office the evening before the broadcast, and earlier in the week, he was taken in a military helicopter to a tightly controlled area along the country’s southern border, generally off limits to journalists, in the presence of a Hungarian minister. There, Hungary became the idealized backdrop for Carlson’s habitual preoccupations: Thanks to a barbed-wire fence, Hungary’s border area was “perfectly clean and orderly,” free of the “trash” and “chaos” that mark other borders of the world. Consequently, “There weren’t scenes of human suffering.” He did not bring up the fact that civic groups have repeatedly taken the Hungarian government to court for denying food to families held in immigration detention centers.",How the American Right Fell in Love With Hungary,2021-10-19T09:00:44+0000,article,Magazine,News,"Dreher, Rod;Conservatism (US Politics);Right-Wing Extremism and Alt-Right;Hungary;Orban, Viktor;Carlson, Tucker;United States Politics and Government;Politics and Government;Content Type: Personal Profile;Christians and Christianity;Immigration and Emigration;Race and Ethnicity;Homosexuality and Bisexuality;Transgender and Transsexuals"

They also use roving chickens to forage for pests, maximize soil fertility by planting cover crops like ryegrass and employ a herd of sheep — referred to as “woolly weeders” — to help fertilize the fields.

2503,"Pot brownies and colorful gummies may look harmless and can be easy to hide, but it’s important for caregivers to help adolescents understand the risks.","A few years ago, my high school daughter came home talking about rumors of pot gummy bears circulating at our local middle school. Until then I didn’t realize that I needed to add edible cannabis to the list of topics to address with teenagers in my care. For adolescents, the widespread legalization of marijuana has lowered many of the barriers to experimenting with it. Alongside a range of vaporizers, oils and tinctures, they have increasing access to edibles — pot-infused cookies, brownies, candies and more. This means the conversations parents need to have with their older kids about marijuana have a new wrinkle. The good news is that many of the tactics used to navigate other tricky topics with teens can be deployed to talk about why edibles are not as harmless as they might look.

Your name is Liselle. Your life will soon become a museum of shame.

His wife, a physician whose mother, Carina Santiago Bautista, is the owner and chef of Tierra Antigua near Oaxaca, joined him in the business. Mr. Wangeman said they feature tacos al pastor and that their gringas are made with corn tortillas instead of the more typical wheat but that they use cacahuazintle, an heirloom varietal that is soft and white like wheat flour.

Certainly “The Marriage Plot,” Eugenides’s first novel since his Pulitzer Prize-winning “Middlesex,” was poised to receive tremendous literary interest regardless of subject matter, but the presence of a female protagonist, the gracefulness, the sometimes nostalgic tone and the relationship-heavy nature of the book only highlight the fact that many first-rate books by women and about women’s lives never find a way to escape “Women’s Fiction” and make the leap onto the upper shelf where certain books, most of them written by men, are prominently displayed and admired.",Essay: ‘The Second Shelf’,2021-10-21T14:55:06+0000,article,Books,News,Books and Literature

The materials of “The Makioka Sisters,” widely regarded as the most important Japanese novel since the Second World War, are therefore quite familiar to us in the West. In its massive and tender reconstruction of a moment in social history, its day-to-day explicitness, its full but swiftly evocative dialogue, its psychological directness, it is like the work of a very fertile but conservative novelist of our own culture.

He has written a visually stunning picture of how it looks at the end to two pilgrims on the road to nowhere. Color in the world — except for fire and blood — exists mainly in memory or dream. Fire and firestorms have consumed forests and cities, and from the fall of ashes and soot everything is gray, the river water black.

Probably the novel reflects a national tendency. To be sure, after we have carefully separated ourselves from the soil, we are apt to talk a lot about the advantages of a return to it, but in most cases it ends there.

By whom? Or is it seized? Or revealed?It is earned, mostly, but it is also a matter of temperament. The critic must know more than either writer or academic. He must also value experience and have a truth-telling nature. I think I have that. In their youth most people worry whether or not other people will like them. Not me. I had the choice of going under or surviving, and I survived by understanding (after the iron — if not the silver — had entered my soul) that it is I who am keeping score.

Hopscotching through several continents and 150 years of history, “White Teeth” encompasses a teeming family saga, a sly inquiry into race and identity and a tenderhearted satire on religious antagonism and cultural bemusement. One might be inclined to assume that Smith, who began writing the book when still a Cambridge undergraduate, has bitten off more than she can chew; one might even feel a little huffy that one so young (she is 24) has aimed so high.

Anne Boleyn, the tease eager to supplant her, won’t let the king know what she’s wearing until their wedding night; she says “yes, yes, yes” to him, “then she says no.” Thomas More, willing to go to any lengths to prevent the marriage, wears a shirt of bristling horsehair, which mortifies his flesh until the sores weep. As for Thomas Cromwell, the fixer who does the king’s dirty work just as he once did the cardinal’s, what is he hiding under his lawyer’s sober winter robes?

The result is a long prose tale that surveys nearly a century of American history as it impinges upon a single family.

In 1996, he co-founded the influential arts and culture magazine Index. And between 2002 and 2011, he served as the director of Yale’s M.F.A. painting program.

A native New Yorker, he works mostly from a 5,000-square-foot studio in West Chelsea, a former industrial building filled with buckets of Day-Glo paint and bins of splattered rollers. But his studio in Connecticut, a modest two-story house wrapped in black-stained shingles that he bought and renovated in 2010, and where he now spends a few days each week, is a very different kind of work space. It serves as both a refuge for making the 17-by-22-inch studies on which his large-scale paintings are based — a meditative process he likens to composing music but with colors instead of chords — and as a memory palace of sorts, filled with furniture and objects from each chapter of his life.","An Artist’s Life in Objects, From a Warhol Print to a Postmodern Lamp",2021-10-27T21:28:05+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Art;Content Type: Personal Profile;Interior Design and Furnishings;Furniture;Design;Halley, Paul"

Marshall was just two years older than Crane, and beyond having the wit to recognize talent when he saw it, he was a generational ally who understood what was new and original in Crane’s work. Five days after Crane died at a sanatorium in the Black Forest on June 5, 1900, Marshall wrote a stunned, tight-lipped article for the New York Herald (“Loss of Stephen Crane—A Real Misfortune to All of Us”) that focused mainly on their wartime experiences together in Cuba but also touched on Crane’s first visit to the Potter Building: “One day . . . a young man came to my office with a letter of introduction. He was thin—almost cadaverous. He wanted work and got it. His article—written for a ridiculously low price—on tenement-house fire panics was one of the best things that he or any other man ever did.
