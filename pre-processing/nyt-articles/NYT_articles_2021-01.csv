361,“Art at the Table” celebrates more than a century of dinners at the Lotos Club in New York.,"Since 1872, New York’s Lotos Club, a literature and arts organization founded in 1870 that occupies a townhouse on East 66th Street, has regularly held banquets to honor notables in the arts, government, science, entertainment, sports and the business world. Well-known people tried pulling strings to be the featured guest. The dinners also include elaborate menus, sometimes featuring the art of the honoree. It’s all documented in “Art at the Table,” a lavish new book that describes around 120 of the 439 dinners that have been held through 2019. In the first 50 or so years, oysters, green turtle soup, fillet of beef and an ice cream dessert dominated the menus. Back in 1874, King Kalakaua of Hawaii was the celebrity guest, but no women were honored until 1922, when the opera singer Mary Garden was selected. (Women could not join the club until 1977.) The authors have threaded anecdotes throughout, like Mark Twain’s nap during his 12-course meal, a special Peruvian menu served for Mario Vargas Llosa and the menu printed on a Beethoven score for Richard Arnold, a violinist. The name of the club was taken from “The Lotos-Eaters” by Alfred Tennyson.",Remembering the Stately Dinners of a Private Club,2021-01-05T03:31:14+0000,article,Food,News,"Cooking and Cookbooks;Lotos Club (Manhattan, NY)"

In May, they opened a weekend pop-up butcher in the kitchen of Faun, and its success justified their idea. Now, they have opened their own butcher selling nose-to-tail meats from a number of local farms, 32 to 230 miles away as listed on their website. “We couldn’t have gotten started without the pandemic,” Mr. Hammond said. “The restaurant kitchen wouldn’t have been available for our pop-up.” The shop is worker-owned. “I wanted the people who helped to build this business to get something out of it,” Mr. Brockman said. “The food business is really difficult, and this way we can pay a decent wage and know the workers would be more dedicated.” There are three other people involved in the shop. In addition to a variety of cuts of meat and poultry, the shop will offer rotisserie chickens, charcuterie, condiments and seasonings, and sandwiches.

2160,Stack rugs on the floor. Hang drapery or acoustic-foam tiles. Adjust your expectations.,"“Stack rugs or wrestling mats on the floor,” says Yoron Israel, who leads the percussion department at Berklee College of Music in Boston. Sound doesn’t want to be contained; it undulates easily through air, concrete, brick and wood. In fact, it moves faster through solids, with their more densely packed molecules. An acoustic drum set is a high-decibel instrument with low frequencies particularly suited to spreading. Adjust your expectations: You can’t truly soundproof a room without decoupling it from the larger structure, which means building a new room within your existing room, preferably with several inches of air space and acoustic insulation between the two. Such a project will cost thousands of dollars, and if you’re a renter, landlords aren’t likely to sign off. You can buy pricey, prefabricated sound-insulation rooms, but Israel often advises his percussion students to go the cheaper, sound-dampening route. To do that you’ll want to hang drapery, acoustic-foam tiles or even mattress toppers over walls, ceilings, floors and doors. If you’re a drummer and can get away with it, leave your windows uncovered. “You deserve light,” Israel says. “People always make drummers play in basements.”",How to Soundproof a Room,2021-01-12T10:00:02+0000,article,Magazine,News,Content Type: Service;Noise;Interior Design and Furnishings

We ended up spending the next two evenings and nights together. Hopeful that we might actually make it stick, I stayed in touch, even once I figured out that he had already — before his visit — entered another relationship. He wrote me heartfelt, regret-filled emails and assured me that he was working on extricating himself from this “Plan B.” After connecting on and off for months via email, text and phone, I learned not only that he had entered a relationship but also that it was with an old flame, and that he slipped an engagement ring on her finger well before came to see me. I feel great pain and sympathy for his fiancée, who has been as betrayed and disrespected as I have. We are both victims; he selfishly stole a year of my life and caused me emotional trauma sure to haunt me forever, and she is probably preparing to enter a marriage that will be defined by lies. She just doesn’t know it. I want this woman to walk down that aisle with her eyes open; but there’s a part of me that wonders whether I am just seeking revenge.

His partners are Rafiq Salim and Paul Wetzel, previously sous-chefs at Gramercy, and Ben Howell, who was a bar manager there and is overseeing front of the house. The pastry chef is Kelly Mencin, who is not a partner but was also at Gramercy Tavern. It took these colleagues more than five years to come back together for this project. The space is divided into a front room, meant to be the bar with banquettes and some high-top tables, and a partly skylit dining room that can seat about 100 people and has an open kitchen fitted with a wood-burning oven and grill.  For now, the bar is a counter where baked goods, homemade pastas, dips, sauces and ice cream are sold to take away, along with grocery items, wines, liquors and cocktails that use locally made spirits. The chefs have come up with a dinner package, $17 per person, for takeout and delivery that consists of a main dish like grilled porchetta with sides, including fried rice and cauliflower salad. Wood-fired half chickens, grilled greens, braised butter beans with salsa verde and focaccias with substantial toppings are among the other menu options. Housemade charcuterie is on the horizon. Stephen Maharam, a regular Gramercy Tavern customer, is another partner, running the business side, and Kermit Westergaard, the architect and contractor, is also a partner by virtue of owning the building.

The latest is Mashama Bailey, the chef who owns The Grey in Savannah, Ga., with her business partner, Johno Morisano. (The Grey opened in 2014, and is named for its location in a former Greyhound bus terminal.) Chefs from restaurants in Paris, Mumbai, Buenos Aires and Santiago, Chile, have been in residence with Intersect’s chef, Nickolas Martinez, and Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group, to run its kitchen. But the recent cancellation of indoor dining has finally turned the Intersect’s informal luxury toward takeout and delivery only. The Grey’s three-course menus with sides, $65 per person, plus tax, gratuity and delivery, are posted weekly on Mondays, and available Thursdays through Sundays. Its residency will continue through mid-April. At the Grey, Ms. Bailey, a Bronx native who moved with her family to Savannah in 1980, then back to New York before returning to Savannah, stitches together a personal take on Southern and soul food. This week’s nicely packaged menu features smoked catfish with rye crackers, yardbird chicken with captain sauce, and devil’s food cake. Leeks vinaigrette, red snapper and butterscotch cream will be served next week, and, the week after, there will be crab Louis, smoked lamb and a brown-butter fritter. Southern-style cocktails will also be sold. Intersect, which has a program of culinary training for formerly incarcerated youth, is donating 500 meals to health care workers.

Not just snow: “The Trapper” (1921) by Rockwell Kent also depicts a lone man; a dog; mountains, clouds, and sky; a pale half-moon. But it was the snow, along with the blue shadows graphed over it, that gripped me. In the dimly lit room (its dimness exacerbated by the over-bright sun outside) the whole painting seemed to glow. I couldn’t stop looking. The winter of 2019 would prove to be one of the warmest on record, during which only 4.8 inches of snow would fall. Stumbling on Kent’s painting felt like unearthing a picture of a lost loved one: the recognition, the elation, the grief. Yet I only wanted more. My daughter had asked that morning if it would ever snow again. I knew it would, but I also knew that, here and elsewhere, it will snow less. In northern Europe snow festivals had been canceled. In Hokkaido, Japan, snow had been imported by truck.

Many require items like magnolia leaves, lily bulbs, kuromame (sweet black beans) and abura-age (a kind of fried tofu).

6605,"Inspired by Formica-tiled countertops from the 1950s, one of the motifs from the brand’s spring 1996 show has been put to new use.","Cartoon bananas, Surrealist lips, apocalyptic Hawaiian florals, kitschy tail fins with flames — Miuccia Prada is known for her eccentric prints and patterns. Another iconic motif arrived 25 years ago with Prada’s spring 1996 collection, arguably one of the designer’s most influential. Dubbed Banal Eccentricity — the show notes cited a 1980 exhibition at the Venice Biennale featuring mass-produced ordinary household objects — it hewed to a palette of avocado greens, rusty ochers and eggplant purples, which featured on solid-colored minimalist pieces and those with squiggly, hand-scribbled plaids that took cues from midcentury wallpaper and kitchen design. Another print — which was composed of overlapping abstract squares inspired by 1950s Formica-tiled countertops and appeared on gabardine midlength overcoats and pencil skirts — became synonymous with the concept of ugly chic. If that now seems like an overused descriptor, revisiting the collection is a reminder of the brand’s ever-prescient vision. Ushered onto the runway by a waifish brigade that included Kate Moss and a pixie-haired Carolyn Murphy, it stood in stark contrast to the slick sexiness of Armani and Tom Ford’s Gucci — and it subverted traditional notions of good taste, and even earned comparisons to Dior’s New Look. “If I have done anything, it was making ugly cool,” Mrs. Prada herself once said. “Ugly is attractive, ugly is exciting.”","A Famous Prada Print, Back With a Twist",2021-01-28T17:36:18+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Prada SpA;Fashion and Apparel;Textiles;Prada, Miuccia;Simons, Raf"
