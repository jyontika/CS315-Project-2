It was the early 1990s, in the era of Scared Straight programs aimed at curbing juvenile delinquency, and Gaspar and her classmates were deemed “at risk,” by virtue of where they lived — the West Side of Chicago — and who they were, many of them first-generation immigrants from Mexico. Back then, on any given day, Cook County Jail, located in the city’s South Lawndale neighborhood, housed some 8,000 people, a third of them pretrial detainees unable to post bail, mostly men, Black and brown. Gaspar remembers her frightened teachers, all of them white, scurrying through tiered cellblocks; the inedible food served to them in the mess hall; the guards scolding the young visitors for crossing their legs and for “not being ‘clean.’” But her clearest memory is of the faces of those who gazed back at her from their confinement. “I remember feeling like the guys behind bars looked like people down my block,” she says. “They just looked like people I knew.

After all, his movies are as much about atmosphere as they are character; to him, objects are also metaphors, whether a marble corridor that stands in for bourgeois restraint or a peach that represents the opposite. His most recent creation, a fireplace, was inspired by its function as the spiritual center of the home. Forgoing traditional materials such as stone and brick, he had Munich’s famed Nymphenburg Porcelain Manufactory fabricate this vivid pastel-hued ceramic hearth, which can be made in different sizes and palettes (he has one in his own country home in the Piemonte region of Italy). “The difference in working with this material versus, say, marble is that you’re not chipping away to see what emerges — you’re building from nothing,” he says. To Guadagnino, the “brash, glossy” rainbow surfaces suggest a dancing flame, though the fireplace is built to withstand real heat. “There may be a little crackling to the finish,” he says, “but I think that’s beautiful.

1699,"The pair’s pink and red gems are reminiscent of the beguiling Caesar’s Ruby, a jewel that was passed among monarchs over hundreds of years.","Part of the Russian crown jewels for centuries, Caesar’s Ruby turned out not to be a ruby at all. The more than 255-carat raspberry-shaped gem, which was made into a pendant with leaves of gold and green enamel, has a peripatetic history: After the 1574 death of its first known owner, Charles IX of France, his wife, Elisabeth, brought it back to her home in Austria. It was later looted by Sweden during the Thirty Years’ War and eventually given as a gift to Catherine the Great. But during an inventory of the Russian collection in 1922, the mineralogist Aleksandr Fersman made a shocking discovery: Caesar’s Ruby was, in fact, a rubellite tourmaline. While classified as semiprecious, such tourmalines, which derive their color from manganese, are actually rarer than rubies. By mixing deep scarlet rubies with tourmalines, which tend to come in shades of tender rose, in a pair of pink gold chandelier earrings, Bulgari, the 138-year-old Rome-based luxury brand, has created an explosion of shimmering coral reds that trace the curve of the neck.

But recently, a group of female pastry chefs have been upgrading the condiment to the main event — and moving beyond the expected fruits as they do. Among the pan dulce that Teresa Finney, a second-generation Mexican American baker, serves at her Atlanta pop-up, At Heart Panadería, are chiffon cakes spiced with pepper, cinnamon and nutmeg, sweetened with piloncillo and stuffed with seasonal fruit compote. Similarly, Milena Pagán brings her Puerto Rican roots to the menu at Little Sister in Providence, R.I., with jam combinations including guava and raspberry, as well as blood orange and hibiscus. And at Flourish Bakeshop & All Day Café on Long Island, Chelsea Kravitz creates preserves out of butternut squash and other produce from her garden, which add color to her yogurt bowls, cocktails and dukkah-flavored whipped ricotta toast.

Though they will all play important roles in the novel, these characters are so conventionally positioned that they are never even given proper names; they are Mother, Father, Mother’s Younger Brother, Grandfather and a child known only as “the little boy.” The little boy, we are told, has lately developed a fascination with Harry Houdini, although, being too young to frequent vaudeville houses and the like, he has only read obsessively about the world-famous escape artist, never seen him in the flesh. And in the next paragraph, a car — nay, “a black 45-horsepower Pope-Toledo Runabout” — crashes into a telephone pole in front of the little boy’s house, on that sleepy street in out-of-the-way New Rochelle; the unharmed passenger, who then comes to the front door to apologize, is Houdini himself.","With ‘Ragtime,’ E.L.

2560,A new generation of artisans are paying homage to the centuries-old craft even as they subvert it.,"A broad-shouldered farmer, scythe in hand, gazes out over a field of asparagus. At first, the young man, subtly veined with craquelure and rendered in cobalt blue on a tin-glazed ceramic Delft tile, appears to have come from the 17th or 18th century, when more than 800 million such tiles, often bearing similar pastoral sketches, were produced in Holland. But on closer inspection, there are differences: This cropper is shirtless, his backside a bit too pert, and the stalks of asparagus growing from the ground are, in fact, penises. Made in 2019 by the 54-year-old British artist Paul Bommer — who has also worked phallic imagery into tiles variously depicting what might be initially mistaken for a kite in ancient China, a prize squash and chickens being fed by an old lady — the provocative scene reflects a larger rediscovery of Delft-style tiles by a new generation of history-upending ceramists.","Delft Tiles Get a Playful, and Sometimes Raunchy, Update",2022-08-19T14:00:10+0000,article,T Magazine,News,Handicrafts;Ceramics and Pottery;Delft (Netherlands)

2572,"Inspired by the bracelets worn by the Hollywood star Gloria Swanson, this intricate and reversible accessory can transform from a bangle into a timepiece.","In 1912, Cartier introduced its first mystery clock. The hands seemed to float magically around the dial as if without anchor but were, in fact, attached to two disks of transparent rock crystal. The object’s popularity coincided with the return to fashion of the translucent crystal, a fixture of the house’s haute joaillerie innovations of the time. Two decades later, Gloria Swanson — one of the biggest movie stars of the 1920s — purchased a pair of Cartier rock crystal and diamond bracelets. Crafted with an expandable row of carved hemispherical half-disks, the bangles had no clasp, and their monochromatic, oversize bombé shape stood out on the black-and-white screen when she wore them alongside Laurence Olivier in her 1933 film, “Perfect Understanding.” An extravagant woman (she had a 24-room Beverly Hills estate), Swanson adopted the Cartier bracelets as one of her trademarks both on- and offscreen, wearing them in publicity stills and at awards ceremonies. Later, she incorporated them into her wardrobe when she made her comeback in 1950 as Norma Desmond in Billy Wilder’s “Sunset Boulevard.”","A Cartier Watch, Ready for Its Closeup",2022-08-19T15:00:07+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Jewels and Jewelry;Cartier SA;Sunset Boulevard (Movie);Swanson, Gloria;Olivier, Laurence;Wilder, Billy;Watches and Clocks"
