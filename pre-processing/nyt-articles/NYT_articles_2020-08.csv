She and her nine cooks were getting used to working with masks on, but were they allowed to act the way they normally did, she wondered, like some amalgamation of an athletic team and a family?

1157,"Transforming discarded fabrics into forward-looking men’s wear, Priya Ahluwalia draws on her family’s Nigerian and Indian roots.","In 1990s South London, a young Priya Ahluwalia would watch as members of her extended family got ready for garage raves, styling themselves in matching two-piece sets, dresses with chain belts and patterned silk shirts. “All the guys wore earrings,” she recalls. “I used to wish I could go party with them, too.” Perhaps her longing helped crystallize these memories, because similar pieces, such as candy-hued sweater vests, vividly patchworked hoodies and jackets made from deconstructed Levi’s, have found their way into some of the 27-year-old British men’s wear designer’s recent collections. In fact, a thread of nostalgia runs through all of Ahluwalia’s designs: In addition to drawing from the aesthetics prominent during her own childhood, she pays homage to those of other cultural epochs, as well as to her family’s Nigerian, Indian and Jamaican heritage and the broader immigrant experience in the United Kingdom.",The British Designer Paying Tribute to the Immigrant Experience,2020-08-10T11:00:24+0000,article,T Magazine,News,Fashion and Apparel;Textiles;London (England);Nigeria;India;Jamaica (West Indies)

This history.” consists of the remains of an unraveled American flag onto which the unmistakable X of the Confederate battle flag, also in tatters, has been woven, the two flags hopelessly intertwined. She believes the election of Donald Trump added fuel to her fire, and indeed, these days, as we witness the continuing state-sanctioned murder of Black people, her work feels especially relevant. Yet the western Massachusetts-based Clark, 53, isn’t making work for the news cycle.

During their five years in the desert, Kamara and her father, a mining engineer, traveled frequently into the nearby mountains, where they visited caves rich with neolithic paintings and polished stone, remnants of a time when the area was green and populated by nomads. “This open archaeological site really gave me a sense of what my region is about,” says Kamara, 41, who splits her time between Providence, R.I., where her husband is a professor of computer science at Brown University, and Niamey, where her firm, Atelier Masomi, has operated since 2014. “It’s not the story we’re fed about Africa being this place with no history.”","In Niger, an Architect Looking to the Country’s Design Traditions",2020-08-10T11:00:24+0000,article,T Magazine,News,ARCHITECTURE;Historic Buildings and Sites;Niger

Gary, flanked by a camera crew and with a microphone in hand, had stopped her to ask a simple question: “Do you feel safe?” Beecher, who is standing with her grandfather, answers yes and proceeds to tell Gary about how she feels prepared to leave the house every day, but that there are times when she is upset about having to wake up early for school. Gary agrees that waking up early is, in fact, the worst, and then asks Beecher if, for the most part, she feels good.

A bride sat onstage in a traditional white lace gown before a banquet of Persian pastries and urns overflowing with pastel-colored roses and baby’s breath. The groom, seated next to her, wore a paisley-printed ski jacket, its high, mouth-covering neck pre-empting the protective masks of the pandemic. An older community leader in a black suit presided over the faux ceremony in Farsi, as the viewers sat divided by gender — men on one side of the aisle, women on the other, though the men outnumbered the women and ended up infringing on their section. This was a deliberate move on Farzaneh’s part intended to highlight the power imbalance she feels in her industry — where a woman truly at the helm of her own brand is still something of a rarity — and was typical of the subtle gestures toward the tensions of our present moment that are embedded in her line. At the end of the ceremony, the groom rose and strode down the aisle, followed by a procession of young men dressed in looks from the fall 2020 collection of Farzaneh’s namesake line, which combined the swagger and oversize silhouettes of streetwear with the understated, earthy palette of hand-printed Iranian textiles.",The Designer Bringing Traditional Persian Fabrics to British Men’s Wear,2020-08-10T11:00:25+0000,article,T Magazine,News,Fashion and Apparel;Men's Fashion Week;London Fashion Week;Iran

Garouste was born into a Jewish family in 1946, just after World War II ended, and had a grandmother who didn’t mince words when it came to describing the recent atrocities. “I transferred a kind of terror onto everything,” Garouste reflects, “and, really, I may have decided to make furniture as a means of taming those items that I grew up with.” Her primary aim for the pieces she now creates is to endow each with a buoyant personality.",The Designer Who Gives Her Pieces Minds of Their Own,2020-08-10T11:00:26+0000,article,T Magazine,News,Furniture;Interior Design and Furnishings;Paris (France)

Thirteen years ago, while working as the director of arts and culture at the British Council in India, Cicolini traveled to Mehrangarh, a resplendent 15th-century fort and series of palaces with an accompanying museum in Jodhpur. Among the collection of courtly textiles, armory and miniature paintings, a maharani jewelry box caught her eye. “It would have housed many of the things you need to perform solah shringar,” she explains, referring to the ancient Hindu practice of a bride on her wedding day wearing 16 traditional adornments, from bell-embellished anklets to glass and gold bangles. “The box itself was fairly ordinary looking, but the idea of what its contents constituted was magic to me.”",The Jewelry Designer Inspired by Ancient Rituals and Artifacts,2020-08-10T11:00:26+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Jewels and Jewelry;Art;Cicolini, Alice"

Thirty-one years ago this month, Yusuf Hawkins was killed in the Bensonhurst neighborhood of Brooklyn, in what became one of the city’s most notorious hate crimes and a sign of its racial divisions in the 1980s and ’90s.

Also interviewed are public figures like the Rev. Al Sharpton, who led protests after the killing and helped turn the case into an argument for change. “I don’t know who shot Yusuf,” Sharpton said at Hawkins’s funeral in 1989, “but the system loaded the gun.”",What’s on TV Wednesday: Documentaries on Yusuf Hawkins and the Go-Go’s,2020-08-12T05:00:06+0000,article,Arts,News,Television;Movies;Documentary Films and Programs

2317,"An excerpt from “The Glass Kingdom,” by Lawrence Osborne","On the upper floors of the Kingdom, as the first winds of the monsoon picked up, the rains swept in just before first light. The cannons of a storm sounded in the distance. In Sarah’s apartment, where she kept the tall sliding windows open, she felt the gusts even in her sleep, the geckos hunting on her walls scattering, moving toward the ceiling and its deeper shadow. She dreamed that she was swimming in an indoor pool back in New York, at the old YWCA near Fifty-Third Street, alone and chilled, until a siren wailed in the distance and the pool disintegrated. Her eyes opened, the equator returned, and the sweat on her back failed to dry. She panicked for a moment and felt for the edge of her mattress to situate herself. What day was it? Koel birds called out across the city, whooping laments, and at once she remembered the waste lots of jungle below her windows with their listing flame trees alongside the ruined tobacco warehouses that had stood there since the Japanese occupation. A faint hum came from the stormy Saen Saep Canal nearby, its black water churning with dawn commuter boats. She was alone among the flies, and the moon was still high above the dirty white skyscrapers of Bangkok.","‘The Glass Kingdom,’ by Lawrence Osborne: An Excerpt",2020-08-18T10:57:41+0000,article,Books,Review,

It wasn’t long after the video game “Space Invaders” landed in arcades, in the late 1970s, that the game’s power to abduct coins from consumers’ pockets became clear. “I went to a head office this one-time and saw a truck collecting money,” the game’s creator, Tomohiro Nishikado, recalls in this documentary. “I saw how the back of it was low down, with bags of money being unloaded from it, sinking into the ground.” The success of “Space Invaders” helped usher in a boom time for video games: The super-hit “Asteroids” came out soon after, followed by “Pac-Man” and “Donkey Kong” in the early 1980s. That period and the decade or so of video-game innovations that followed are the focus of “High Score,” a six-part series. Other interviewees include the game designers John Romero (“Doom”), Roberta Williams (“Mystery House”) and Toru Iwatani, whose explanation of how he came up with his most recognizable creation, Pac-Man, involves a fateful encounter with a sliced-up pizza.",What’s on TV Wednesday: ‘High Score’ and ‘Magic Camp’,2020-08-19T05:00:08+0000,article,Arts,News,Television;Movies;Documentary Films and Programs

2710,Regularly using the most accurate tests possible for millions of Americans is impractical. Could a shift in approach slow the spread of infections?,"Accuracy is everything, typically, when we take a diagnostic test — an incorrect result can lead to anguish and erroneous, if not harmful, treatment. Currently the most reliable way to identify a coronavirus infection is by a polymerase chain reaction (P.C.R.) test: A swab, usually taken from the nasal passage, produces a sample that is then sent to a specialized laboratory. P.C.R. tests, which can detect minute amounts of genetic material from the virus, cost upward of $100; in ideal circumstances, they take just hours to analyze. But because of high demand, supply shortages and other issues, many commercial labs are taking more than a week to process them. That means a positive test often comes back too late to enable contact tracers to notify those who have been exposed before they might in turn infect others. In these circumstances, the diagnosis is useful only for making personal health decisions and providing data on the rate of infection in a community.",What if We Worried Less About the Accuracy of Coronavirus Tests?,2020-08-20T09:00:01+0000,article,Magazine,News,Tests (Medical);Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;JAMA Internal Medicine (Journal);Coronavirus (2019-nCoV);Research;United States

2818,"Nicolas Ghesquière presents a new, if retro-feeling, take on Louis Vuitton’s signature monogram.","Some logos move in and out of favor with the seasons. Then there’s Louis Vuitton’s signature monogram canvas, with its interlaced L and V flanked by various geometric flowers, which seems to be another thing entirely, one impervious to trends and maybe even time itself. In fact, the monogram hasn’t always been around, nor does it date to the house’s founding in 1854, when Louis Vuitton, who had previously been a packer for Empress Eugénie, the wife of Napoleon III, began selling travel trunks out of a store on Paris’s Rue Neuve-des-Capucines, just off Place Vendôme. His go-to motif was a waterproof gray canvas. The monogram came into existence just over four decades later, when Louis’s son, Georges, took inspiration from the kitchen tiles of the family’s home in Asnières in north-central France. The house, built in 1859, was decorated in the Art Nouveau style, and the tile pattern featured a trio of flowers outlined by a clover that was in turn set within a circle, as well as diamonds with petal-like points. Another reference may have been the Gothic Revival then sweeping through France — when seen through that lens, the monogram can’t help but recall architectural quatrefoils carved out of stone or glass in the era’s great cathedrals. What is certain is that, in designing it, Georges was acting in honor of his father, who had died four years prior, leaving the brand’s legacy in his son’s hands.",A Longstanding and Most Iconic Motif Is Reimagined,2020-08-20T17:23:15+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Louis Vuitton;Fashion and Apparel;Ghesquiere, Nicolas"

More than a third of these monuments have been removed since May 25 of this year alone, when a Minnesota police officer named Derek Chauvin, who has been charged with second-degree murder, was caught on video kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, for more than eight minutes while Floyd pleaded for his life.

3427,"An excerpt from “El Jefe,” by Alan Feuer","It came in off the street one day—a tip, a lead, a rumor—whatever you cared to call it, it was one of the strangest things they had heard in their careers. Chapo Guzmán, the world-famous drug lord, had hired a young IT guy and the kid had built him a sophisticated system of high-end cell phones and secret servers, all of it ingeniously encrypted. The unconfirmed report—perhaps that was the best way to describe it—had arrived that Friday in June 2009 when a tipster walked into the lobby of the FBI’s field division office in New York. After his story had been vetted downstairs, it made its way up seven flights of stairs and landed with a curious thud among the crowded cubicles of C-23, the Latin American drug squad. For more than thirty years, the elite team of agents and their bosses had hunted some of the drug trade’s biggest criminals, and while tall tales of their antics circulated constantly through its squad room near the courts in Lower Manhattan, no one in the unit knew what to make of this one. The tipster’s account seemed credible enough but it was sorely lacking details: the only facts he had offered on the young technician were a first name—Christian—and that he was from Medellín, Colombia. All sorts of kooks spouting all sorts of nonsense showed up all the time at FBI facilities, claiming they had inside information on the Kennedy killing or knew someone who knew someone who knew where Jimmy Hoffa was. In what were still the early days of Internet telephony, it seemed a bit far-fetched that a twentysomething hacker had reached a deal with the world’s most wanted fugitive and furnished him in hiding with a private form of Skype. As alluring as it sounded, it was just the sort of thing that would probably turn out to be a myth.","‘El Jefe,’ by Alan Feuer: An Excerpt",2020-08-25T09:01:00+0000,article,Books,Review,

These were the early days of autumn, and his arms and cheeks were still summer-bronzed and freckled over the last layers of his baby fat. He was eleven years old and an expert butterfly collector. Probably the top kid-lepidopterist in Champaign County, in his own humble opinion. At night his bones ached and added marrow, and each morning his limbs felt more sinewy and masculine, as if he’d somehow entered the body of Davy Crockett. Or Daniel Boone.

In the blink of an eye, a sputtering first date turns into a high-stakes run from the law in “Queen & Slim,” the debut feature from the music-video and television creator Melina Matsoukas.

On their way home, they are pulled over by a police officer (Sturgill Simpson) — an encounter that turns deadly. Suddenly fugitives, Queen and Slim then run from the law while news of their encounter sparks nationwide attention and protest. The screenplay, by Lena Waithe, taps into urgent conversations about race in America. “I don’t want this movie to be as relevant as it is,” Waithe said in an interview with The New York Times when the film came out. “But the scary thing is the movie becomes more and more relevant with every passing day.” That was late last year.",What’s on TV Wednesday: ‘Queen & Slim’ and ‘Hamlet’,2020-08-26T05:00:18+0000,article,Arts,News,Television;Movies

3978,Revisit Christopher Nolan’s debut feature. Or stream the latest movie from the filmmaker Sally Potter.,"FOLLOWING (1998) Stream on Criterion Channel and IFC Films Unlimited; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes and YouTube. When hardy audiences trek to theaters to see Christopher Nolan’s latest mind-bender, “Tenet,” in theaters next week, they can expect two things: masks in the movie house and puzzles on the screen. For that has been the Nolan way for nearly two decades: In 2001, Nolan’s “Memento” offered “a series of clever epistemological puzzles,” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. Nolan’s film “The Prestige,” from 2006, “has a satisfyingly puzzlelike structure,” Scott wrote in his review. The filmmaker’s 2010 dream-hopper, “Inception”? It “trades in crafty puzzles,” Scott wrote. “Interstellar” in 2014? “Tantalizing puzzles,” Manohla Dargis wrote. All echo “Following,” Nolan’s 1998 debut feature, which gave a taste of his knack for cinematic discombobulation. Shot on a shoestring — the cost of making “Following,” reported to be in the low thousands, was surely less than the hair gel budget delegated to the men of “Inception” — the film plays fast and loose with chronology, telling the story of a young Londoner (Jeremy Theobald), whose hobby of tailing strangers leads him to the city’s criminal underbelly. In her review for The Times, Janet Maslin called the movie “a black-and-white film noir with a difference,” writing that “the usual elements of scheming and deception are well represented here, but they are made all the knottier by shifting time frames.” And, she noted, the story “offers plenty of intriguing puzzle pieces.”",What’s on TV Friday: ‘Following’ and ‘The Roads Not Taken’,2020-08-28T05:00:07+0000,article,Arts,News,Television;Movies
