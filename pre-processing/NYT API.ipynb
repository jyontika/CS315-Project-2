    "3. Write a function that given one article (in its nested structure), creates a flat dictionary with keys that are relevant for analysis: either the abstract or snippet (see point 2); lead paragraph; headline; keywords concatenated via semicolon; pub_date; document_type; section_name; and type_of_material\n",
    "4. Write another function that calls the function from point 3 on every article, to create a list of article dictionaries, and convert this list into a dataframe and then store it as a CSV file with the date-month in the title (this is important for point 5 below).\n",

    "5. Once you have done all of these in the notebook, create a Python script that can be called with a date (from a TikTok video). First, the script looks whether a CSV with cleaned articles is in our folder. If not, calls first the API function to get the articles and then the function that converts them into a CSV. Then, it loads the CSV into a dataframe and it uses filtering to get the articles for the desired date. These articles will be used for the Semantic Similarity portion of the TikTok Project.\n",
