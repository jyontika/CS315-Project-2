 This might not be what Amberlynn looks like. So in pop culture Amberlynn is this like sexy, sultry gal who is stealing your mans. And honestly in my head this is what she looks like too. But when Jane Seymour did an uno reverse on Miss Amberlynn and stole her mans too, her and her shitty husband Henry VIII destroyed all contemporary pictures of Amberlynn. And that's because Jane Seymour didn't really want to live in the shadow of Amberlynn anymore and even banned the French hood which Amberlynn popularised. But anyway. So this is the only contemporary portrait we have of Anne.
