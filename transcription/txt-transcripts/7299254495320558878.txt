 How can you be sad when you're in Happy Valley? We are Penn State! God, this place is sick! The King is back in state, home for a weekend. You know I'm sending chance tonight with the squad. I don't care how much I gotta pay online leave. I don't. Used to feel like a legend walking these streets. Still do. You know us Nittany Lions. Can't drink all day unless you start in the morning. My family goes back five generations of Nittany Lions. Wait till Michigan weekend when we bring out our custom fitted RV. Michigan blows, bro. Michigan blows. Jim Harbaugh's the champ!
