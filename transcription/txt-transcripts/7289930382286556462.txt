 I don't know if you've been paying attention, but Amy Schumer is losing her mind. I do not follow Amy Schumer on social media. I can't take it. I wouldn't be able to handle it. But I keep seeing these things on Twitter and TikTok. I'm like, let me go see for myself. She's literally having a meltdown right before our eyes. Since the Israel-Humas attack, Amy Schumer has been using her platform basically asking why people aren't checking up on her, almost calling out other people that belong to her.
