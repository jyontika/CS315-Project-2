 I remember when we broke up the first time, saying, this is it, I've had enough. Because like we hadn't seen each other in a month. When you said you needed space, what? Then you came around again and say, baby, I miss you. And I swear I'm going to change, trust me. Remember how that lasted for one day? I say, I hate you. We break up, you call me, I love you.
