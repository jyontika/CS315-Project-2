 Alright, what's up guys? So this is Kalani over here and in case you don't know who she is, she's a really famous singer and she's been posting on her Instagram story showing support for Palestine every single day. But recently she posted something very interesting. Take a look. She posted a picture of the Holy Quran on her story. Listen, all I'm saying Kalani is if you have any questions or you need help with anything in regards to Islam or the Quran, you can always reach out to me. I'm gonna tag you below and you guys better tag her in the comments. Don't be lame.
