 The amount of people okay that feel like this lady is astounding Keeflee did nothing wrong. All he did was expose you That's it and that you pissed off that you got exposed. He didn't badmouth no business Y'all literally treated his family like trash Y'all want him to handle y'all with care Y'all better off issuing apology and saying y'all want to do better. Look at this shit man. No respect. No integrity
