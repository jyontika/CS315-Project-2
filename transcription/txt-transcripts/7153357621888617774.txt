 Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, was mocked for her Indigenous Peoples' Day tweet, in which she noted the extraordinary resilience and the rich cultures of tribal nations and Native communities. It would seem that she said everything correctly, but the tweet garnered a lot of attention due to Warren's earlier false claims of Native American ancestry, while a special test revealed that she was only between 1 64th and 1,024th Native American. Social media users did not miss the opportunity to remind her about the test.
