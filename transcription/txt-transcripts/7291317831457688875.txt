 I'm Israeli Jewish, American as well. My partner is Palestinian and I can do things that he can't do. I can travel quite freely and even though his mother is a refugee from what is now Israel, he can't pass areas that are off limits to Palestinians. I have excellent rights, I have health, there are cities in Israel being built for Jews only and also in the West Bank settlements being built for Israeli Jews only. While Palestinians are hemmed in
