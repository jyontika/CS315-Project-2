 The music industry has done Bebe Rexha dirty so many times. And if you're not caught up on some of those other times, click the comment that this is replying to and you'll see I've already done two other videos on Bebe Rexha. But this time we got to talk about the time that G-Eazy and Britney Spears performed her song that she did with G-Eazy, Me, Myself and I, live at the VMAs without telling her it was going to happen and replacing her vocals with Britney's. I'm sure you all know this song, right? Welcome to my series, Dirty Pop.
