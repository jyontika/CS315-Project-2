 Take a look at this, it's like something straight out of a sci-fi movie. A plane appearing to hang in mid-air over San Francisco. Your eyes are not playing tricks on you. It's actually an optical illusion called the parallax effect. So when you're moving past another moving object and it appears to be stuck, the video has gone viral with some people calling it a glitch in the matrix. Yeah, I wonder if it's still there.
