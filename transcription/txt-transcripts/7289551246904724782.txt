 not palestinian but i am muslim wild israel palestine situation is not a matter of jews vs muslims i guarantee you that most people that are posting in solidarity with israel have been conditioned with the narrative of jews vs muslims so for me when i see someone posting that and it's someone that i know or am distantly even in the vicinity of i take it as a personal attack it's a saying that goes like if islam was the body palestine is the heart see so many muslim influencers and all these sellouts not stand up to these people so infuriating
