 UCAS is scrapping the personal statement system for uni admissions. It says that the current system widens the gap between the students who have helped with their application and those who don't. Instead it's going to be replaced with six questions about things like how ready you are for the course, have you taken steps to prepare for uni? Do you think that's going to make life easier or would you prefer a longer essay? Let us know in the comments.
