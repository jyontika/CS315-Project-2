 Listen, I'm gonna say something and it might be a hot take nobody is more pro-palestine than Israeli influencers Whether it's going viral for wearing a hijab and pretending to be a Palestinian doing your makeup while you're getting bombed Doing a oh damn my life as I'm in war getting gluten-free cookies and I just know the IDF hates you So many people I've seen that were neutral now support Palestine because they're like these are the people that are supposed to be scared for their lives Why the fuck are you doing a new jeans choreo on tik-tok?
