 I can't be a Zionist. No way. Such an injustice, such a cruelty, such a distortion. I mean, you know, maybe 10, 15 years ago, a lot of Israelis were not so ardent Zionists. They've become more ardent. I was brainwashed as a youngster. I was a Zionist. I was proud of Israel. I had to, you know, educate myself.
