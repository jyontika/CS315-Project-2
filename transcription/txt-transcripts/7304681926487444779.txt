 We just shut down the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. If you're watching at home, apparently they keep stopping the TV every couple of minutes. I think because they don't want to show what's going on. There are quite a few disruptions happening there. We are heading to our second location, but the cops have blocked us off because they don't want us to go and march back into where the parade is because they're afraid we're going to go and shut it down again.
