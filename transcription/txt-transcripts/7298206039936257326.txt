 You banged up that finger, everything okay? Yeah, just a little scratch. That's football, baby. What is it that you can do, Joe, now that you could not do at the start of the season? Run. Run. But, you know, we're feeling great. We're just gonna keep getting better every week. The practice has been big for us. We've had a great couple weeks of practice, starting with the bye week. We're just gonna keep getting better.
