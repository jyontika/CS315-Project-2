 My dad thinks I'm shoplifting? I can't believe he doesn't trust me. I feel so betrayed. I can't believe Charlie Brown would lie to us. You think you know someone after half a week of school? You know what? We're gonna teach him a lesson. Him and my father. He's coming. He's coming. Everybody, act suspicious. Go, go, go.
