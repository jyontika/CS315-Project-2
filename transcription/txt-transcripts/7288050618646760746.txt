And so somebody was like, okay, where we finna go? So somebody else was like, you know what, we just finna go back to our granny in them house, we gon' take off to the motherland. So they had decided like, we finna go back to the Middle East and they ended up in Palestine. So they get to Palestine and the Palestinians was like, okay, we got some company, like, you know, we got some visitors. And then they realized they had visitors, had to spend the night back. So the Palestinians was like, so what y'all finna do?
