 Okay, so this is Michigan. This is the Upper Peninsula. I'm from Lansing, Michigan, which is right in the center, and it's the capital city, the heart of Michigan. But I live here now, and this is like Canada right here, and the lakes. But I live in Detroit, which is the east side, and then like west side is like Grand Haven. Right? Okay, yeah. That's us. We're in Lansing right now.
