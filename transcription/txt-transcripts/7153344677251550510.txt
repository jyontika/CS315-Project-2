 Fake German heiress Anna Sorokin got all dolled up Tuesday morning as she stepped out from house arrest in Manhattan for the first time to see her parole officer.

The socialite scammer, whose court-ordered ankle monitor was briefly visible under her pants while leaving her new East Village apartment, ignored questions before getting into her SUV.
