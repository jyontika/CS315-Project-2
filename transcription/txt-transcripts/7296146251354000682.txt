 New York City Marathon is this weekend and I made a list of things that I wish I knew. Some pro tips, if you will. Number one, put your name on your shirt. I did not do this when I ran New York last year and I regretted it so, so much. You can order like iron-on letters on Amazon. You can just write it in Sharpie. You can write it on your bib. But people will cheer for you and they'll scream your name and it gives you like the biggest boost of energy. Spectators like yelling names instead of just like generically cheering.
