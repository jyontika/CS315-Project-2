 Uber is offering $200,000 in free rides for Temple University students. The goal here they say is to keep those students safe. Through the end of the year, Temple students can actually log in to their Uber account using their school email and enter the code TempleRideHome. The ride sharing service will give each student up to four rides worth up to $20 each.
