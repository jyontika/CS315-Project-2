 Oh my goodness, this is the first time I've seen these pictures. This just coming into our newsroom, this is Celery on a major highway north of Toronto. A truck rolled over in the southbound lanes of Highway 400 spilling all this celery on the road. Traffic is being diverted off the highway while crews try to clean this up. This is going to lead to a closure that will last several hours.
