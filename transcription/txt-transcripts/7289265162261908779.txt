 I am unapologetically pro-life. Not because the Republican Party tells me to be, but because my husband was adopted and I had trouble having both of my children. So I'm surrounded by blessings. Having said that, I don't judge anyone for being pro-choice any more than I want you to judge me for being pro-life. This issue is personal for every woman and every man and it needs to be treated that way. In some cases, states have become pro-life. I welcome that.
