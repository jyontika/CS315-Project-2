 Look at this side of the chime and today Mr. War Criminal himself, Barack Obama, more of the same war criminals justifying war crimes. I was just thinking today we haven't heard from Mr. Beacon of Humanity and Morals in over a week, the same guy that sends thousands of drones and kills thousands of civilians. And just like I expected, the statement checks out that dehumanizing language is all there because when Israelis die, they get horrifically attacked and murdered. And then let's just bury in the fact that thousands of Palestinians were also victims, but who really cares?
