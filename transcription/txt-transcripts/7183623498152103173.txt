 Shakespeare made up words, didn't he? He did that all the time. Mm-hm. He made up so many words. He made up about a thousand words that we still use today. Did he? Mm-hm. Like, I've got a list of words... OK. ..that he might or might not have made up. OK. And you tell me if Shakespeare made them up or not. OK. Cuckoo. No, I don't think so. Ukulele. No. Trouple bowling. No. Seafax. No. Omnishamble.
