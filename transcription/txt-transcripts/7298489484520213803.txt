 Elf has an advent calendar? I did order it. I think I would come more prepared. Ah! So close! Oh my gosh! She's pink! Not gonna lie, I don't know why I thought this would be like under $50. It was still $90. It's 24 days, but I'm expecting some full-size products. I'm not gonna lie because if not, that seems so expensive for Elf. Alright, just double check. It's a $95 advent calendar and it has a retail value of $124. Axe advent calendar was only $100 more than this and it contained all full-size
