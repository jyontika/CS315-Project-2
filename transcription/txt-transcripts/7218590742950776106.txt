 This is America's most inbred family. From a small village named Odd, they are known to bark, grunt and run away if approached by strangers. Twins John and Henry Whitaker had children John and Gracie who decided to get married, even though they were cousins. John and Gracie went on to have 15 children of their own. This has left the Whitaker children with numerous genetic defects and unable to communicate with the outside world. Filmmaker Leda first met the West Virginia family in 2004 to take photos for his book, Created Equal.
