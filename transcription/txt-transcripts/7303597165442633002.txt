 I just want to let y'all know if y'all are hitting a paywall on anywhere, you can just go real quick, copy that link, go to archive.ph, put in that lil news link, and it'll tell you how long it is and then you can save it again if you want a more recent one. And cause they updated it, it'll take like 5 minutes. And then you can access the article. Don't tell anyone.
