 I have zero desire to ever run a marathon in my entire life, but what I will say is that I want the attention that comes along with it. Like I want to go to a bar after and wear a medal and people be like, oh my god, you did it, congrats, you're amazing. And I'd be like, I know, but I want that without having to run the 26 miles because that's absurd and I'm not insane.
