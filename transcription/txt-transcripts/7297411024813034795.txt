 Backplates that scream JV bro. Listen man a couple of days back I made all the backplates that scream D1 bro So you already know for a fact it was only fair that I had to show off some love with the backplates that show JV. That just scream JV vibes. Let's go ahead and get the video poppin bro. Let's go man. Coming in at number one we have the Gear Protech. I'm not gonna lie if you got this backplate you are absolutely garbage. This is by far one of the most generic backplates that every JV player be seeming to get their hands on. Like bro y'all have all these other options in the score and y'all over here picking the Gear Protech?
