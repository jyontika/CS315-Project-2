 Something that I don't think the movie really captured is the inner monologue that you get in the book with Snow that really just shows how deranged he is at his core and I think that's really demonstrated in his first interaction with his grandma in the book. In the movie she places the rose on his lapel and it's this very cute moment the whole scene is very wholesome it just shows you that he has something to fight for.
