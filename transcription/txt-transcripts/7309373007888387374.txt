 I don't want to hear shit about boycotts not working. I don't want to hear another peep. Remember how much power you have. Don't ever doubt the impact of one person. Because when one person, two people, three people add on top, have a collective mindset to do anything, United, nobody's fucking with us. It really doesn't matter what it is. There is no company too big, no person too big, no entity too big.
