 This is the best night, I think, of my life, perhaps with the possible exception of the night that I married my wife 30 years ago. I didn't know it, but she and my sister kind of plotted while I was a midshipman at the Naval Academy. She had a picture on the wall in her room, and I think I just fell in love with the photograph, and he asked me for a date. And my mama asked me, Jimmy, what did you do last night? And I said, I went to a movie. She said, did you go with anybody? And I said, yeah, I went with Rosen Smith. And she said, what did you think of her? And I said, she said, well, I'm going to marry.
