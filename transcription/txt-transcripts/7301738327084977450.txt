 Tomorrow is Red Cup Day at Starbucks and I am so excited to tell you that we're still boycotting. What are you talking about? Get that shit off my timeline right now. Okay? We're still boycotting. No holiday menu, no cookie crumble latte, no Red Cup is gonna get us to go inside that establishment. Okay? Are you listening? Put your listening ears on.
