 So did I. This past August, a group of former Glossier employees launched an Instagram page called Out of Gloss in which they catalogued their grievances with the company. This letter is pretty long and it is a few pages, but the gist of it is, first of all, they did not feel protected by their employer at all, facing a lot of discrimination with even their customers. This part of the letter here shows that the HR department was practically non-existent and that claims from employees often went unaddressed or were just completely excused.
