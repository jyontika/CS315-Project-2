 Do you have supervision? I'm going to give you a test to find out if you do. It is claimed that only 8% of the world's population has supervision, a condition also known as tetrahormatic vision, which means that they have a fourth retinal cone, allowing them to see more colors than the average person. Here's a superficial test I found online if you have supervision. Identify the dot that's different from the rest.
