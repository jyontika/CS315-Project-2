 Yafa Bakery won best new bakery in Boston this year and I recently stopped by and can confirm they totally deserve it. This Palestinian-owned spot offers a wonderful spread of savory breads, colorful pastries, baklava, kunafa, and more all made in-house. Just one glance at their display and you can tell all their pastries are a work of art and they put so much work into them. They also offer other dishes beyond pastries. Their hummus was as authentic as it gets and their levna was delicious. Don't forget to grab a coffee, tea, or try their delicious laminata while you're there. Yafa brings you traditional and modern
