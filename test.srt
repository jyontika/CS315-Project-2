00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Call me crazy here, but

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,520
Would a tiktok band be the worst thing on planet Earth if it were to happen?

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,080
And this is coming from someone like tiktok is my job like my livelihood is at stake with this potential ban here

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,640
And like I'm just thinking like I was scrolling on tiktok for four hours last night four consecutive hours

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,880
I was just just scrolling like just doom scrolling just hours away and like this happens multiple times a week

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,400
Like so would it be the worst thing the world if it was gone and even if it is gone

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,640
It's not gonna be gone for another like six months anyways

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,320
But still like the only thing I would miss and besides like the community and like all the great things tiktok has brought me and like

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,360
You know the connections on stuff

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,920
I would miss my drafts and I would miss all my saved likes and videos cuz I'm a very nostalgic person

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,320
So I like to scroll all the way back to like my first like videos all the way from like

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,040
2019

13
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,560
And just like watch those back, but like I feel like I could just get my life back man

14
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,760
I don't know I could like just explore other hobbies interests of myself like yeah

15
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,280
sure of course I would miss tiktok and all the great things it's done, but

16
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,200
Would it be the worst thing in the world if it was gone? I don't know. That's just my thoughts
