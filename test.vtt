Call me crazy here, but

00:03.280 --> 00:06.520
Would a tiktok band be the worst thing on planet Earth if it were to happen?

00:07.320 --> 00:12.080
And this is coming from someone like tiktok is my job like my livelihood is at stake with this potential ban here

00:12.080 --> 00:17.640
And like I'm just thinking like I was scrolling on tiktok for four hours last night four consecutive hours

00:17.640 --> 00:22.880
I was just just scrolling like just doom scrolling just hours away and like this happens multiple times a week

00:23.880 --> 00:27.400
Like so would it be the worst thing the world if it was gone and even if it is gone

00:27.400 --> 00:29.640
It's not gonna be gone for another like six months anyways

00:29.640 --> 00:35.320
But still like the only thing I would miss and besides like the community and like all the great things tiktok has brought me and like

00:35.320 --> 00:36.360
You know the connections on stuff

00:36.360 --> 00:41.920
I would miss my drafts and I would miss all my saved likes and videos cuz I'm a very nostalgic person

00:41.920 --> 00:45.320
So I like to scroll all the way back to like my first like videos all the way from like

00:46.240 --> 00:48.040
2019

00:48.040 --> 00:52.560
And just like watch those back, but like I feel like I could just get my life back man

00:52.560 --> 00:56.760
I don't know I could like just explore other hobbies interests of myself like yeah

00:56.760 --> 00:59.280
sure of course I would miss tiktok and all the great things it's done, but

01:00.120 --> 01:03.200
Would it be the worst thing in the world if it was gone? I don't know. That's just my thoughts
