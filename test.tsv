0	2000	Call me crazy here, but
3280	6520	Would a tiktok band be the worst thing on planet Earth if it were to happen?
7320	12080	And this is coming from someone like tiktok is my job like my livelihood is at stake with this potential ban here
12080	17640	And like I'm just thinking like I was scrolling on tiktok for four hours last night four consecutive hours
17640	22880	I was just just scrolling like just doom scrolling just hours away and like this happens multiple times a week
23880	27400	Like so would it be the worst thing the world if it was gone and even if it is gone
27400	29640	It's not gonna be gone for another like six months anyways
29640	35320	But still like the only thing I would miss and besides like the community and like all the great things tiktok has brought me and like
35320	36360	You know the connections on stuff
36360	41920	I would miss my drafts and I would miss all my saved likes and videos cuz I'm a very nostalgic person
41920	45320	So I like to scroll all the way back to like my first like videos all the way from like
46240	48040	2019
48040	52560	And just like watch those back, but like I feel like I could just get my life back man
52560	56760	I don't know I could like just explore other hobbies interests of myself like yeah
56760	59280	sure of course I would miss tiktok and all the great things it's done, but
60120	63200	Would it be the worst thing in the world if it was gone? I don't know. That's just my thoughts
