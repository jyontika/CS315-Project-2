 That is indeed a triceratops eating meat. I am so glad you brought that up. I specifically chose that photo so that I can make a video like this because I wanted to talk about this topic again. So here we are. So why on earth would a triceratops be eating meat? I mean, it's primarily an herbivore. It would stick to plant life. That's what it has its adaptions for. That makes complete sense, correct? Well, not necessarily because the same logic can be applied to modern day animals that are primarily herbivores and, you know, completely vegetarians. On screen right now, you'll see plenty of photos and videos of herbivores
