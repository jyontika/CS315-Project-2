 The owners of the car usually put the number of their car here, so no one steals it. The houses in Yakutsk are built on stilts, which are about 15-20 meters deep in the ground. Otherwise, the heat from the house would melt the permafrost. And when this happens, the house would dip in the ground and be destroyed. The drivers also leave the engine of the cars on when they leave for a session.
