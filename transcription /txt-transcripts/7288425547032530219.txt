 a lot of people have said things like oh i'm hesitant to speak on what's happening in palestine oh i don't want to pick a side i don't feel like i know enough this is such a complicated nuanced issue i don't know enough so i'm not going to say anything and in general that's a good thing we should not speak on things we do not know that's what gets a lot of people in trouble on the internet in the first place and i'm not speaking now because i think i'm some type of expert in fact i'm the furthest thing from it i used to say these exact same phrases in an attempt to remain neutral in a situation i feel like i didn't understand but then i asked myself and i implore you all to ask yourselves why
