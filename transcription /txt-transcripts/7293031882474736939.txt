 You know, as a Romani person, I often hear from both sides of the political spectrum that us Romani people need a homeland. On one side we have, y'all are indigenous to South Asia, you don't belong here. On the other, y'all are indigenous to South Asia, you don't belong here. Both are equally harmful. This idea comes from the fact that yes, Romani people, we come from South Asia.
