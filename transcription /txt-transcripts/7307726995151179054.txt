 The funniest thing in the world is taking the train with a whole bunch of white people. Once the train gets to the urban ghetto fucking stops, the entire fucking car leaves. What you mean you're not getting off at 125th? Like what happened? You wanted to move to New York so bad. So stay on the train for one more stop, I'm gonna take you to Broadway Junction.
