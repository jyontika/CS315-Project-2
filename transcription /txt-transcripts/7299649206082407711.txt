 No one is denying that Elvis was a predator. The age gap between him and Priscilla was weird then, it is weird now. And while she doesn't explicitly say it in her memoir Elvis and Me, Priscilla makes it very clear that Elvis had a lot of people around him enabling this behavior. We know that Elvis and Priscilla met in Germany when she was 14. He was stationed there and her family was living there because her father was in the military. The story Priscilla tells in her memoir of how she and Elvis met was that she was at a diner with her two brothers and a soldier came up to her and said, do you know about Elvis? And she said yes, because at that point he was already famous and had been drafted.
