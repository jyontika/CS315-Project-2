 We gotta talk about the time Tattoo, the teenage Russian faux lesbian duo, pissed off two late night hosts in America in one week. And yeah, this story includes very creepy comments from Jimmy Kimmel to these teenage girls. Also welcome to my series Dirty Pop, where we talk about controversies, conspiracies, and the underbelly of pop. But before we can talk about what happened on his show, we gotta go backwards. On February 25th, 2003, Tattoo appeared on Jay Leno's show, The Tonight Show, first. Now if you know anything about Tattoo during this time, they had a specific shtick on stage.
