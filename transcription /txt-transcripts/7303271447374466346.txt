 If Palestinians really wanted peace and freedom, they would have accepted statehood the five times Israel offered it to them. Why should they? Because it's very generous of Israel to offer that to them. So if a burglar came into your home and then said it was his, and then was like, you know what, nevermind, do you want half of it? Would you say that he was being very generous? That's not nearly the same thing. Israel's giving them like 80% of the land.
