 I put an AirTag in a slice of pizza, covered it in epoxy resin and brought it on a plane to a city over a thousand miles away. When I got there I assembled a treasure out of an old ammo box consisting of an authentic World War II dog tag, a tiny bottle of whiskey, adventure socks, a cigar, a brand new Tesla, and 20,000 yen worth of coins. I put in the AirTag pizza slice, closed up the box, buried it, and marked the spot with an old pink chair someone had left under a rope.
