 An Airbnb tenant is refusing to leave after overstaying her welcome at a luxurious guest home in LA unless she gets paid $100,000. Elizabeth Hirshhorn booked a long-term stay at Dr. Sasha Jovanovich's guest house in September of 2021 until the spring, bringing her rent total to over $20,000. But since April 2022, she's still been living at the home rent-free and refuses to leave unless she gets her requested six-figure relocation fee from Jovanovich, according to the LA Times.
