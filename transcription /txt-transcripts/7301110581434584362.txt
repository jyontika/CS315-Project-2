 This is the story of why I quit my Division 1 sport. I was in third grade when I started playing lacrosse for the first time. And it wasn't until fifth grade where I knew that I wanted to play at the Division 1 level. And at such a young age I was thinking about what I needed to do to get there. I needed to show up to practice early every day, which I did. I needed to play my hardest, which I did. I needed to make varsity as a freshman in high school, which I did. I needed to get a 4.0 GPA in high school, which I did. I needed to email coaches and attend their prospect camps, which I did. And to me it was all I needed.
