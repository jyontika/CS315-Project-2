 Hi guys, my name is Anna Dalby. Welcome to my apartment. I just transformed this space into kind of like my personal gallery. All these pieces are from the local room. They are part of the same collection, those black pieces that I have over here and here. And this piece is kind of like, looks like a window a little bit because in this room I already have the skylight. This is a sculpture. I thought it would be the perfect place because the microwave, you can switch the light. I love, it's like a little gallery.
