 As a Jewish person who was indoctrinated into Zionism, one of my earliest stirrings of anti-Zionism came when I realized I was associating my Jewish identity with Israel. In the Jewish community, Jewish people and Israel are synonymous. We are all Israeli, by a certain extent, even if we don't have an Israeli passport or citizenship. We have this kind of unofficial citizenship to Israel.
