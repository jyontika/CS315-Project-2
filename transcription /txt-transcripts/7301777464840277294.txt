 Got cars, biggest bars, they got rivers of gold. With the windows right through you, there's no place for the old. When you first took my hand on a cold Christmas eve, you promised me Broad Street was waiting for me. The sound of the Silver Age's choir all singing, Yahweh Bey. And the bells were ringing out for Christmas Day.
