 Kylie Jenner has lost 1 million followers on Instagram after sharing support for Israel and quickly deleting it. She used to have 400 million followers and now she has 399. Again, a lot of the comments on her most recent Instagram posts are showing support for Palestine and others are sharing their support for Israel. At this point, I think Kylie Jenner has pissed off both sides. Israeli people are upset that she posted and quickly deleted her support and Palestinian people are upset that she posted at all.
