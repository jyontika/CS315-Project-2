 Jews and Christians were given identifiable clothing. The yellow star, which was given to the Jews that most people think is a German invention, it was actually an Islamic invention in the 9th century in Iraq by the second Khalif, Khalif al-Mutawakkil of Iraq, who invented the yellow star for the Jews to be identified as they walked down the street.
