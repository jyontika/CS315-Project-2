 What were you doing while your mother was being killed? I was sitting in the bathroom on the bathroom floor with my hands covering my ears. And how did you know when it was over? It was the code that we settled on to use. You settled on this code together? Yes. What was the code? I believe it was three knocks and two scratches on the door.
