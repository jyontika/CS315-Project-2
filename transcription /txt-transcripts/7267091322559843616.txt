 The same waters that our people just died in three days ago are the same waters the very next day these visitors, tourists were swimming in. And that says a lot about where their heart and mind is through all of this and where our heart and mind is. You don't see our people swimming, snorkeling, surfing. Nobody is having fun in tragedy and continuing their lives like nothing has happened. There is two Hawai'is right now. There is the Hawai'i we're living in and the Hawai'i they're living in, they're visiting in.
