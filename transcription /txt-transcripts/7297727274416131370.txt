 Lana Del Rey was never the correct choice to play Priscilla Presley, and that's something I never thought I'd say, but hear me out. I used to be obsessed with the idea of Lana playing her style icon in some kind of glamorous biopic because it would be so satisfying to see her emulate somebody who influenced so much of her earlier aesthetic. After seeing Sofia Coppola's work Priscilla, it makes so much sense why the casting was integral to telling this story. The bulk of this story is Priscilla's life as it relates to Elvis, and that took place between the ages of 14 and 28 for her.
