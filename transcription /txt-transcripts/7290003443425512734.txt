 Hey, this is Mom. I got a new number. Just picking up a few things. Don't make me drink alone. And I don't want to hear any of this, I have homework crap. Don't make me drink alone. Don't make me drink alone. Don't make me drink alone. Are you guys mad at me for something? I mean, I risked my job so that you could have fun, and we definitely did. The least you could do is, you know, say thank you. Hey guys, it's Z-Wan. Look, I really need you to meet me at the Rock Piles after school tomorrow. It's an emergency. Please come.
