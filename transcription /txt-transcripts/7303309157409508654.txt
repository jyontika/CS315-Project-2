 Why would Lucy Grey make this statement toward the end of the ballad of songbirds and snakes? Spoilers ahead. So at the very end of the movie is Lucy Grey and Corio are running away together. They come to a cabin at the lake and in that cabin Corio finds the gun that he shot Mayfair with and Lucy Grey mentions that they can get rid of the guns so that all the evidence of his crime will be gone. But then after that sentence, Lucy Grey decides to add in the words, except me. Meaning that she is the only person left who knows Snow's secret. But why did she say this?
