 When I drank that whole glass of wine, I had to do that like three times. I was like, let's go again, let's go again. And I had like, you know, the craziest poop of my life that day. It was gonna be grape juice, but the non-alcoholic wine, which still had like 0.02% alcohol or something, looked more realistic. I was pretty excited to do it though, that was really fun.
