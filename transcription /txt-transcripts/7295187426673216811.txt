 Shout out to all my K-pop fans out there, except anybody whose alt bias is an 04 liner, anybody whose alt bias's name starts with the letter R, anybody whose alt bias is American, anybody who is actually overcharged on their credit card because of K-pop related purchases, anybody who was introduced to K-pop via Blackpink, but then their alt group ended up becoming Twice and you're Momo biased,
