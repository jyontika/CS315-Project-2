 Hey, do you know what time it is? You know what time it is? It is 2 55 pm. That means in five minutes that Popeye's across the street is gonna be filled with goddamn high schoolers and our only chance of getting a goddamn chicken sandwich is gonna be goddamn next week. So I'm out. God damn it. How was the bathroom, sir? Far, nigga. It was far. Well, uh, we have a surprise for you guys today. It's the, uh, Chef Special. A very rare delicacy, especially here in Georgia. Blowfish cheap. And as you all probably heard, blowfish are extremely poisonous and must be cut with a skilled hand. But Chef Kenny, he studied with the finest and Demarcus oversaw the cutting himself.
