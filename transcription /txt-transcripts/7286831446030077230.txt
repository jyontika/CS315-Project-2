 Why everyone is freaking out about Congress right now. Imagine the House of Representatives is K-Pop band with 435 members that can't do anything without a lead singer. Well imagine Jenny is the lead singer, aka the Speaker of the House. Even though only a slight majority wants her to be. Most of the rest want Jisoo to be lead singer, even though she doesn't really have a chance. And like 10 people want Rosé? Well to calm everyone's nerves, when she became lead singer, Jenny said that if only one person in the band complained about her, the whole band could vote to kick her out if they wanted. Well, that was maybe not the smartest move because apparently Rosé hates Jenny. And after only 10 months of Jenny being lead singer, Rosé complains.
