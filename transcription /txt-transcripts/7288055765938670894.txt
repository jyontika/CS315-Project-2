 I'm not Jewish, I'm not Muslim, I'm not Israeli or Palestinian, I'm an American and from my perspective here is how I see the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. How I see it, the way Zionists came into power in Israel is a parallel of how English colonists came into power in the United States of America. You have Christians and Jews coming to another part of the world to escape religious persecution. The British gave both Christian colonists and Jews charters to live on the land.
