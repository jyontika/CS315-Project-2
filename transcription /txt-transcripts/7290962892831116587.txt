 This isn't an Indian restaurant, and neither is that. In fact, it's estimated that about half the restaurants in New York City that claim to be Indian restaurants are actually owned and staffed by Bangladeshi people. So back in the 1970s, Bangladeshi immigrants looked to open up restaurants in the US, but they faced a huge marketing problem. No one was really familiar with Bangladesh. So to make it easy for Americans to understand, they would use Indian names and carried the menu with dishes like curries or chicken tikka masala, which was invented in Britain to appease the Western palate.
