 Hi, my name is Neve. Explain what you do in overly simplistic terms. I am a filmmaker at night and 24-7 I am a personal assistant to an NFL player and that is my entire life. It never stops. And what's the non-negotiable in your morning routine? Non-negotiable is skipping my rose water. And what's one thing you wanted to change about yourself?
