 I think I just figured out why the US, UK and France are so adamantly pro-Israel right now. Like we all know it had to do with money, but I'm gonna tell you exactly how. There's a shout out to my uncle who told me to do some research on the Ben Gurion canal, and I did, and I took notes. Now who is Ben Gurion? He is known as the founding father of Israel. He was the first prime minister, yes you guessed it, in 1948. And this canal is a proposal to connect the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea through here, right? But we already have a connection.
