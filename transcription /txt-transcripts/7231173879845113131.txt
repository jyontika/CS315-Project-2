 One of the biggest questions I always get asked is do people actually get shorter over time and also if you get shorter can you correct it and also get a little bit taller? So what happens is with your body when you hunch through different things of poor posture over a long period of time when you're seeing your desk run non-stop or you're not working out your joints compress on top of each other. Basically just like that. These discs are filled with fluid but when you compress them over time they gradually lose that fluid that's normally in them. Can you fix them is the next biggest question. So if you're like this how can we get you taller? There are simple simple stretches that you can do over time that'll force your body into extension to get you a little bit taller for sure.
