 i have a question for people in the united states yes it pertains to israel and palestine but this is also like a general question are y'all not skeptical when our government agrees on something on both sides and if not why? and i'm not talking about the obvious condemnation of like brutality and loss of human life because a if you're a politician you're supposed to do that if you do otherwise it's pretty bad for your campaign but b almost any common sense person would feel so as long as they have like a beating heart it's why it's
