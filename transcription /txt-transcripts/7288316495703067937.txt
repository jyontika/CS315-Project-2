 You guys need to stop idolising celebrities and whether they support Palestine or Israel. Like you guys that do this are just so cringe and out of touch with reality. Like I came across this post and it's about celebrities who support Palestine and the comments made me want to pull out my eyeballs and put them in a blender. So I don't get what is with making this whole thing aesthetic. There was always that one girl in history class where she'd make her notes all nice, pretty, add flowers, glitter, but the topic would be about the Holocaust. This is just giving off the same vibes. Anyway the celebrities involved in this were Michael Jackson, Cesar, Zara Larsson,
